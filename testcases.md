# AxloPOS — System Test Cases

Master test-case inventory for the Hardware POS system (web + API). Each case
has a stable ID for traceability into automated Playwright specs.

- **Type**: `P` = positive (happy path), `N` = negative (error/guard path)
- **Status**: `Not Run` → `Pass` / `Fail` / `Blocked` / `Automated` (update as
  cases are executed manually or scripted)
- Unless stated otherwise, cases assume the seeded demo tenant and the roles:
  Owner (email login), Salesperson (email login), Manager, Cashier,
  Accountant. Salesperson is owner-equivalent — every gate the owner
  clears must open for it too.

### Notes for automation

- IDs are stable — name Playwright specs after them (e.g. `pos.spec.ts` →
  `test('POS-005 typed quantity clamps to stock', …)`).
- Seed-dependent cases (AUTH-007, ADM-*) need the dev seed or the provisioning
  script as fixtures; QB-* cases need a QuickBooks sandbox connection and are
  best tagged `@quickbooks` so they can be excluded from CI without secrets.
- Concurrency cases (PAY-014, PAY-015) are API-level tests, not browser tests.
