# AxloPOS — System Test Cases

Master test-case inventory for the Hardware POS system (web + API). Each case
has a stable ID for traceability into automated Playwright specs.

- **Type**: `P` = positive (happy path), `N` = negative (error/guard path)
- **Status**: `Not Run` → `Pass` / `Fail` / `Blocked` / `Automated` (update as
  cases are executed manually or scripted)
- Unless stated otherwise, cases assume the seeded demo tenant and the roles
  the hardware template staffs: Owner (email login), Salesperson (email
  login) and Cashier (PIN). Manager and Accountant are enum tiers with no
  seeded user since 2026-08-17. Salesperson is owner-equivalent — every gate
  the owner clears must open for it too — and, since D108, is linked to the
  hardware template's `SALESPERSON` role row and offered by no other template.
  The Retail template (D120) staffs Owner and Cashier only (`GENERAL_ROLE_TEMPLATES`,
  no Salesperson); PROD-031…047, EXC-T-008…012, STK-* and RPT-* assume a provisioned
  `RETAIL` tenant unless stated.

## PERM — Roles & Permissions

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PERM-001 | Owner sees all nav entries | Log in as owner | Dashboard, POS, Sales, Quotations, Returns, Products, Suppliers, Customers, QuickBooks, Settings visible | P | Not Run |
| PERM-002 | Cashier nav is restricted | Log in as cashier | No Suppliers, Settings, or QuickBooks management entries | P | Not Run |

## DASH — Dashboards

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DASH-001 | Admin KPI band shows 5 cards | Owner opens dashboard | Net Sales, Gross Profit, Credit Receivable, Total Inventory Value, Open Quotations | P | Automated |
| DASH-002 | KPI cards on one row at laptop width | 1280×800 viewport, sidebar expanded | All 5 cards share one row | P | Not Run |
| DASH-003 | KPI row unaffected by sidebar collapse | Collapse sidebar at 1280×800 | Still one row | P | Not Run |
| DASH-004 | Millions render compactly | Inventory value ≥ Rs. 1,000,000 | Shown as `Rs. X.XXXXmil` (≤4 decimals, zeros trimmed) | P | Not Run |
| DASH-005 | Sub-million values keep full format | Card value 999,999.99 | `Rs. 999,999.99` (no "mil") | P | Not Run |
| DASH-006 | Inventory value equals cost × on-hand | Compare card to SQL Σ(qty×cost) over active Inventory items | Values match; null cost counts as zero | P | Not Run |
| DASH-007 | Inventory card deep-links to products | Click Total Inventory Value | Navigates to /products | P | Not Run |
| DASH-008 | Out-of-stock alert count matches list | Compare alert count vs /products?stockStatus=OUT total | Counts equal | P | Not Run |
| DASH-009 | Alert deep-link applies filter | Click out-of-stock alert | Products page opens pre-filtered to OUT | P | Not Run |
| DASH-010 | Low-stock alert requires reorder point | Product below default-less threshold, no reorderLevel | Not counted as low stock anywhere (dashboard + POS) | N | Not Run |
| DASH-011 | Low-stock consistency dashboard vs POS | Product with reorderLevel ≥ on-hand | Flagged low in both dashboard alert and POS badge | P | Not Run |
| DASH-012 | Cashier KPI band shows shift stats | Cashier opens dashboard | Shift Sales, Transactions, Average Bill, Expected Cash | P | Not Run |
| DASH-013 | Sales chart range switcher | Toggle Today/7D/30D/3M/6M/1Y | Series refetches; axis rescales; no errors | P | Not Run |
| DASH-014 | Dashboard degrades when API down | Stop API, load dashboard | Error state with Retry; no crash; Retry recovers after API returns | N | Not Run |
| DASH-015 | Branch/register chips absent | Inspect header + dashboard hero | No "Main Branch"/"Register 1" labels (kept only in account dropdown) | P | Not Run |
| DASH-016 | Empty tenant dashboard renders zeros | Fresh tenant owner logs in | All KPIs zero/empty states; no NaN or errors | P | Not Run |
| DASH-017 | Payment methods card matches sales | Complete sales via two methods, view card | Split/amounts per method match the recorded payments | P | Not Run |
| DASH-018 | Top categories/products ranked correctly | Known sales mix in window | Ranked by amount; units and sale counts correct | P | Not Run |
| DASH-019 | "Today" boundary respected | Sale completed yesterday (server-local midnight) | Excluded from today's Net Sales / Transactions | P | Not Run |
| DASH-020 | Cashier register health card | Cashier dashboard | QuickBooks health + expected cash consistent with shift summary | P | Not Run |
| DASH-021 | Receivable card counts every unsettled balance | Read /dashboard/stats, complete a credit sale, read again | `outstandingReceivable` rises by exactly the sale total | P | Automated |
| DASH-022 | An account payment comes off the receivable at once | Part-pay an account, then clear it | The receivable drops by the part payment immediately, and by the full amount once cleared | P | Automated |
| DASH-023 | Receivable is not windowed | Switch the dashboard range (Today → 1Y) | Credit Receivable is unchanged — money owed does not stop being owed at midnight | P | Not Run |
| DASH-024 | Receivable card deep-links to who owes | Click Credit Receivable | Customers page opens filtered to customers with credit outstanding | P | Not Run |
| DASH-025 | Upcoming reservations are on the service dashboard (D148) | Sign in as the restaurant owner, then the waiter, then the restaurant cashier, with bookings in the next few hours | All three see an Upcoming reservations card listing the soonest bookings first, each showing time, guest name, table and party size; clicking a row opens the calendar | P | Not Run |
| DASH-026 | The card shows what is COMING, not what is seated (D148) | With one booking earlier today already finished, one in progress and one later tonight, read the card | The finished booking is absent, the later one is listed, and a booking whose time has just passed but who has not been seated is still shown — the window starts at the current moment, not at midnight | P | Not Run |
| DASH-027 | A role without the reservation book is told so (D148) | Sign in as kitchen staff or any role lacking reservation:view and open the service dashboard | The card says the reservation book is not part of that role. It must NOT show an empty card, which would read as "nothing booked tonight" | P | Not Run |
| DASH-028 | The service dashboard fits its screen (D148) | Open the dashboard at 1440, 1280 and 1024 px wide with plenty of open tables, kitchen tickets, bookings and takeaways | The page itself never scrolls: header and tiles stay put, all four panels are visible, and any list too long for its panel scrolls INSIDE that card. At phone width the page scrolls normally | P | Not Run |
| DASH-029 | View Reports opens Reports (D172) | Dashboard as an owner/manager → click **View Reports** in the action bar (it may be under "More actions" on a narrow window) | Lands on **/reports**. Before D172 it went to /sales — every signal about the button said Reports except its link, and it had never worked since the dashboard shipped | P | Not Run |
| DASH-030 | The buttons beside it are unchanged (D172) | On the same bar, click **Create Quote**, then **Add Product** | /quotations/new and /products/new. Several KPI TILES on this screen still go to /sales on purpose — a metric drills into the list its number came from — and that is not the same thing as the action button | P | Not Run |
| DASH-031 | View Reports is hidden without permission (D172) | Sign in as a role lacking `report:read` and open the dashboard | No View Reports button, and the rest of the action bar is still there. Same permission the sidebar's Reports entry uses | N | Not Run |

## PROD — Products & Categories

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| PROD-009 | Category `Parent:Sub` created on the fly | Assign a new path during create/import | Category + subcategory created once, reused thereafter | P | Not Run |
| PROD-010 | Category reorder persists | Drag/reorder categories, reload | Order kept in management list and POS chips | P | Not Run |
| PROD-011 | Deactivate category | Deactivate a category with products | Hidden from POS chips; products remain accessible via search | P | Not Run |
| PROD-012 | Subcategory move between categories | Move sub to another category | Tree updates; product assignments intact | P | Not Run |
| PROD-013 | Product list filters combine | Stock=LOW + sync=SYNCED + search term | Result satisfies all predicates | P | Not Run |
| PROD-014 | stockStatus=OUT filter exact | Apply OUT filter | Only Inventory items with qty ≤ 0 | P | Not Run |
| PROD-015 | Export respects active filters | Filter list, export | File contains only filtered rows | P | Not Run |
| PROD-016 | Upload product image | Attach JPG/PNG on product | Stored via storage provider as WebP; renders in list/POS via presigned redirect | P | Not Run |
| PROD-017 | Replace and delete image | Upload new image; then delete | Old object replaced; delete clears imageUrl and POS falls back to placeholder | P | Not Run |
| PROD-018 | Oversized/invalid image rejected | Upload 20MB file / a .txt renamed .png | 4xx with clear message; product unchanged | N | Not Run |
| PROD-019 | Image never sent to QuickBooks | Sync product with image | QBO Item payload contains no image data | P | Not Run |
| PROD-020 | Duplicate SKU within tenant rejected | Create product with existing SKU | Conflict error surfaced | N | Not Run |
| PROD-021 | Pagination boundaries | Navigate to last page; request page beyond last via API | UI clamps; API returns empty items, correct total | N | Not Run |
| PROD-022 | Search by SKU and partial name | Search exact SKU, then substring | Matching rows only, case-insensitive | P | Not Run |
| PROD-023 | Hard delete product without history | Delete a never-sold product | Removed from list and POS | P | Not Run |
| PROD-024 | Delete product with sales history handled | Attempt delete of a sold product | Blocked or soft-handled; old sale detail still renders its line | N | Not Run |
| PROD-025 | Negative reorder point rejected | reorderLevel −1 | Validation error | N | Not Run |
| PROD-026 | QB account names shown read-only | Product pulled from QBO with income/expense/asset accounts | Account names displayed, not editable locally | P | Not Run |
| PROD-027 | Subcategory library is browser-local (known mock) | Assign shared subcategory, open app in second browser | Assignment absent there — frontend-only adapter until backend lands | N | Not Run |
| PROD-028 | Sold out is a switch, not a count (D101) | Restaurant owner marks a dish sold out, then available again | `soldOutAt` set then cleared; the POS card greys out and comes back; a repeat 86 keeps the original timestamp | P | Not Run |
| PROD-029 | The 86 switch refuses stock-governed kinds (D101) | PUT /v1/products/:id/availability on a STOCK_ITEM or a booking kind | 400 `PRODUCT_AVAILABILITY_STOCK_GOVERNED` naming what governs it; a waiter/cashier may 86 a dish but not edit the catalogue | N | Not Run |
| PROD-030 | Product wizard enforces name and SKU limits | Type past 200 characters in Product name and past 80 in a SKU; leave a variation option blank; give two variations one name | Typing stops at the cap; the counter appears from 160 characters and reads 200 / 200 in the warning colour; a restored draft or an older row over the cap is refused with "Product name is limited to 200 characters." / "SKU is limited to 80 characters."; "Option needs a name."; "Variation names must be unique." | N | Not Run |
| PROD-031 | Retail template provisions with the clothing categories (D120) | Run `provision-tenant.ts --business-type RETAIL` without `--with-samples`; log in as the new owner | Profile is `LOCAL` inventory + `NONE` accounting; no QuickBooks rail entry; categories are exactly Menswear, Womenswear, Kidswear, Footwear, Accessories in that order and Footwear has no size scale; zero products; the only roles offered are Owner and Cashier | P | Not Run |
| PROD-032 | Clothing sample pack builds the whole variant chain (D120) | Provision RETAIL with `--with-samples`; open Cotton T-Shirt and Denim Jeans; run provisioning again | T-Shirt has Size S/M/L/XL × Colour Black/White/Navy = 12 variants named from their options (M / Black), not from the SKU `TSHIRT-M-BLACK`, with M / Black the single default; Jeans has waist 30/32/34/36 with 32 default; every variant has its own branch stock row (10 / 6) and a distinct barcode; the parent price is 0 because variants own the price; the second run adds nothing | P | Not Run |
| PROD-033 | A variant product's stock is the sum of its sizes (D121) | Product with four active variants holding 22 units between them while `Product.quantityOnHand` reads 350; GET /v1/products/sellable | `availableQuantity` is `22.000`, derived from the variant rows, never the 350 mirror; `stockState` is OUT only when every size is out, LOW when no size is IN_STOCK (each size against its own reorder point), otherwise IN_STOCK | P | Not Run |
| PROD-034 | The sell cap asks the chosen size, not the total (D121) | In POS pick the Medium (2 on hand) of a shirt whose siblings hold 10; type 3; then POST /sales/complete with quantity 3 for that variant | Till clamps the line to 2; the server refuses "Insufficient stock for <product>" and moves nothing — a sibling with plenty of stock does not rescue an oversold size; the same wording as the product path | N | Not Run |
| PROD-035 | Option library definitions carry codes and swatches (D125/D125a) | Open /products/attributes (URL) → New attribute "Colour": options Black `BLK` #000000, Navy `NVY` #1F2A44, "All categories"; Save; add a second "Colour"; add options `black` and `BLACK`; enter swatch `red` | First saves and lists its options in declared order with 0 products mapped; the duplicate name is 409 `ATTRIBUTE_DEFINITION_EXISTS` "An attribute named "Colour" already exists for this tenant." (another tenant may use the name); `black`/`BLACK` refused 400 `ATTRIBUTE_OPTION_DUPLICATE` naming both names and the one code they normalise to; the swatch reads "Use #RRGGBB, for example #1A1A1A." | N | Not Run |
| PROD-036 | Mapping a dimension to the library is optional and additive (D125) | PUT /v1/products/:id/variations with `attributeDefinitionId` on Size and `attributeOptionId` on each option; leave a second product unmapped; then link an option to a different definition than its dimension, and to another tenant's definition | Links round-trip on GET; omitting the field leaves a mapping alone and `null` clears it; the unmapped product sells and prices exactly as before; both bad links are refused; the library page shows the definition as used by 1 product and its Delete reads "Unmap it from every product before deleting it." | P | Not Run |
| PROD-037 | A mapped library entry cannot be retired (D125) | DELETE /v1/attribute-library/:id while a dimension points at it; PATCH its `options` dropping one a product option uses; unmap, then delete | 409 `ATTRIBUTE_DEFINITION_IN_USE` naming the dimension and option counts; 409 `ATTRIBUTE_OPTION_IN_USE` naming the option and how many product options use it; after unmapping the delete is 204 and the products keep their own dimensions (FK is SET NULL, guarded by the service) | N | Not Run |
| PROD-038 | SKU is generated when omitted, one sequence number per variant (D125) | POST /v1/products/:id/variants:batch for a product in category Apparel, rows omitting `sku`, one option mapped to library code `BLK`; then a batch where one row types `MY-SKU` and its neighbour omits it; then a batch whose generated value collides with a hand-typed SKU | Generated SKUs read `APPAREL-<SEQ>-BLK`, each variant with its own sequence number; the typed SKU is kept and its neighbour still generated; the collision is retried onto the next number, never duplicated (`@@unique([tenantId, sku])`); a second tenant starts at 1 | P | Not Run |
| PROD-039 | Barcode allocation needs a prefix; a typed code is validated by shape (D125) | Retail tenant with no prefix: create a variant leaving Barcode blank; set In-store barcode prefix `2001` on /products/barcodes and retry; then type `2990001000000` (wrong check digit) and `ABC-123-XYZ` | Blank is refused 400 `BARCODE_PREFIX_NOT_CONFIGURED` "No barcode prefix is configured for this workspace…"; after the prefix a 13-digit EAN-13 under `2001` with a valid check digit is issued as `barcodeSource` INTERNAL; a prefix outside the GS1 in-store range is `BARCODE_PREFIX_INVALID`; the 13-digit code is refused `BARCODE_CHECK_DIGIT_INVALID` "…is 13 digits but its check digit is wrong…"; the Code 128 value is accepted as typed; the same barcode on a second variant is refused as a duplicate | N | Not Run |
| PROD-040 | Barcode audit lists only the problems (D125) | Open /products/barcodes (URL) on a tenant holding a valid EAN-13, an invalid-check-digit one and a supplier CODE128 | Summary shows scanned, "With a barcode" and "Wrong check digit" counts; only the `INVALID_CHECK_DIGIT` row is listed with SKU, product and source ("Predates provenance tracking" when null); the CODE128 is counted, not listed; a clean catalogue reads "Every barcode checks out." | P | Not Run |
| PROD-041 | Reissue is explicit and never touches a supplier code (D125) | POST /v1/barcodes/reissue with one INTERNAL invalid variant; then a selection that includes a SUPPLIER row; then `variantIds: []`; then a variant with no barcode | The internal row gets a fresh valid EAN-13 under the tenant prefix and the audit log records the OLD value; the mixed selection is refused wholesale 400 `SUPPLIER_BARCODE` and nothing changes; the empty list is `NO_VARIANTS_SELECTED` (there is no "fix everything"); the bare variant is `NOTHING_TO_REISSUE` | N | Not Run |
| PROD-042 | Brand is a per-tenant entity (D133) | POST /v1/brands "Nike"; again with " Nike "; rename it to "Nike Inc"; set a product's brand; reload the products list and filter | The second is 400 `There is already a brand called "Nike"` (trimmed); the rename shows on every product because the link is an id; the products list shows a "Filter by brand" picker only once a brand exists and `GET /v1/products?brandId=` returns that label only; `productCount` says how many carry it; another tenant may also create "Nike" | P | Not Run |
| PROD-043 | Brands archive, never delete (D133) | PATCH /v1/brands/:id `isActive:false`; GET /v1/brands then `?includeArchived=true`; open a product that carried it; PATCH `isActive:true`; PATCH a product with a brand id from another tenant | Archived brand is absent from the default list and the wizard picker, present with includeArchived; the product still shows it (link kept, no DELETE route exists); restore works through the same route; the foreign brand id is 400 "Brand … does not belong to this tenant"; on a product, an absent `brandId` leaves the brand alone and `""` clears it | P | Not Run |
| PROD-044 | A measured product must name its unit (D134/D134c) | Retail wizard → Pricing: choose "By weight or measure — 0.75, 1.5", leave Unit blank, Save; then enter `kg`; then create a "By the piece" product; open the wizard on a hardware or restaurant tenant | Blank is refused "A product sold by weight or measure needs a unit — for example kg, g or L."; with `kg` the helper reads `The till will ask "How many kg?" and price the amount typed…`; the piece product needs no unit and sends `unitOfMeasure: null`; the control is absent where `catalogue.measuredGoods` is off | N | Not Run |
| PROD-045 | Switching WHOLE ⇄ DECIMAL is allowed and converts nothing (D134b) | On a RETAIL workspace (hardware is refused, PROD-048): PATCH /v1/products/:id `{quantityType:"DECIMAL"}` on a product with no stored unit; again with `unitOfMeasure:"kg"`; PATCH `{unitOfMeasure:""}` on it; PATCH `{name:"Rice"}`; PATCH back to WHOLE | First refused 400 (same message as PROD-044); second accepted; clearing the unit while DECIMAL is refused; the name-only update leaves both fields alone; back to WHOLE keeps the stored unit and 100 on hand stays 100 — no quantity is converted | P | Not Run |
| PROD-046 | A retail tenant starts on the clothing list and may replace it (D64/D161) | Retail wizard → Business details on a workspace that has configured nothing; then PUT /v1/products/:id with `attributes: { allergens: "nuts" }` | Fields offered are Material, Fit (Regular/Slim/Relaxed/Oversized), Care instructions, Gender (Men/Women/Unisex/Boys/Girls), Season, all optional — the RETAIL descriptor's own list, served because nothing is stored; `allergens` is refused as an unknown key until the tenant adds it in Settings → Business details (PROD-051) | P | Not Run |
| PROD-047 | The Taxable toggle names the tenant rate (D122) | Retail wizard → Details with the tenant rate at 18%: Taxable on; Taxable off; set the rate to 0 in Settings → Business and reopen | Helper reads "Tax applies at 18%." / "Zero-rated — no tax is charged on this product." / "This shop's tax rate is 0%, so nothing is charged yet. Set it in Settings → Business."; a product saved with Taxable off is untaxed on a real sale and its line records `taxRatePercent` 0.00 | P | Not Run |
| PROD-048 | Measured goods are refused outside RETAIL by the server (D134e) | As a hardware owner POST /v1/products with `quantityType: "DECIMAL"`; PATCH an already-DECIMAL hardware product's name only, then set it back to WHOLE; repeat the create on a RETAIL workspace | Hardware create is 400 `MEASURED_GOODS_NOT_OFFERED` (the wizard hides the control, the API refuses the assertion); the rename and the switch to WHOLE both succeed — the rule is "you may not assert measured here", not "no measured row may exist"; the RETAIL create is 201 | N | Not Run |
| PROD-049 | Variations come from the attribute library (D125/5.11) | On a RETAIL workspace with a "Size" definition bound to Apparel and an unbound "Colour": Add Product → category Apparel → Variations; pick Size and tick S, M; change the category; also add a hand-typed "Fit" | The picker offers Size and Colour (unbound applies everywhere) and not another category's scales; ticked options become the rows, nothing is adopted wholesale; after the category change a definition it no longer offers is unmapped (`attributeDefinitionId` null) while the typed options stay; the saved product carries the ids on Size and none on Fit; a hardware workspace with no library still gets the free-text fields | P | Not Run |
| PROD-050 | Products search collapses whitespace and can be cleared; categories live on the tab (D137) | Type "rice  curry" (two spaces) in the products search; press the Clear control; look for a Categories button in the header and open the Categories tab | The list matches "Rice Curry"; the field has the accessible name "Search products" and empties on Clear; there is no Categories button in the header and the tab reaches /products/categories | P | Not Run |
| PROD-051 | A retail tenant defines its own business details (D161) | Settings → Business details on a RETAIL workspace: rename Material's label to Fabric, remove Gender (nothing records it), add a Text box "Batch code", add a Dropdown "Storage" with Chilled/Frozen, add a Calendar date "Expiry", Save; reopen Add Product → Business details | Save succeeds; the tab reloads with the six fields and drops the "suggested fields for your business type" note; the wizard's step 2 renders Fabric (text), Fit, Care instructions, Season, Batch code (text), Storage (select with exactly Chilled/Frozen) and Expiry (`type="date"`); `material` is still the stored key, so a product saved before the rename still shows its value | P | Not Run |
| PROD-052 | A business detail in use cannot be taken away (D161) | On the workspace from PROD-051 set a product's Storage to Chilled and save; then in Settings → Business details remove the Storage field and Save; then remove only the Chilled choice and Save; then change Storage's type to Text box and Save; then remove Batch code, which nothing records | Each of the first three is refused with the server's own wording and the count — e.g. `1 product(s) still record "Storage". Clear it on those products before removing the field.` / `1 product(s) are set to "Chilled" for Storage.` — and the editor keeps the operator's edit rather than reloading; removing Batch code succeeds, proving the guard is not "refuse every removal" | N | Not Run |
| PROD-053 | An empty business-details list is a real answer (D161) | Settings → Business details: remove every field (on a workspace whose products record none) and Save; then open Add Product | Save succeeds with "The Add Product form now skips the business details step."; the wizard shows four steps, not five, and no Business details step; the stepper numbering is consistent | P | Not Run |
| PROD-054 | A calendar date is validated as a real day (D161) | With an Expiry date field configured, PUT /v1/products/:id with `attributes: { expiry: "2026-02-31" }`; then `"09/09/2026"`; then `"2026-9-9"`; then `"2026-09-09"` | The first three are refused — 31 February does not exist, and the other two are not the stored notation — and the fourth is accepted; the refusal names the field | N | Not Run |
| PROD-055 | Business details are RETAIL only, on the server as well as the screen (D161/D56) | As a hardware owner GET /v1/products/business-details and PUT it; repeat as a restaurant owner; then open Settings on both | Both verbs are refused 400 `BUSINESS_DETAILS_NOT_CONFIGURABLE` for both business types; neither workspace shows a Business details tab; the hardware wizard still shows no attributes step and the restaurant one is unchanged | N | Not Run |
| PROD-056 | A stored list stops being read once the workspace is no longer retail (D161) | Configure a list on a RETAIL workspace, change its business type to HARDWARE, open Add Product; change it back to RETAIL | Hardware serves its own (empty) schema and the stored list is ignored, not enforced; changing back restores the tenant's list intact — it was never deleted | N | Not Run |
| PROD-057 | The Inventory tab bar shows only the sub-surfaces a workspace has (D162) | Open /products on a RETAIL workspace, then on a HARDWARE one, then on a RESTAURANT one; on each read the tab row | Retail shows all seven — Products, Categories, Promotions, Attributes, Barcodes, Stock, Purchases; hardware shows the same WITHOUT Attributes; restaurant shows them without Attributes AND without Barcodes. Products / Categories / Promotions and the two disabled placeholders are present in every case, so no bar is ever empty | P | Not Run |
| PROD-058 | Hiding a catalogue tab removes no route and no API (D162) | As a restaurant owner navigate directly to /products/attributes and /products/barcodes by URL; then GET /v1/attribute-library | Both pages still render and the API still answers — D125 made the library shared core on permission, not on business type, and D162 hides a tab rather than gating an authority. The tab row on those pages simply has no tab highlighted | N | Not Run |
| PROD-059 | Retail's sale document is the thermal bill, not an A4 sheet (D163) | On a RETAIL workspace open a completed sale; then run a sale through POS → Payment and complete it | The sale page offers **Thermal receipt** and no **Print A4 bill**; the payment screen shows no “Print A4 bill after payment” toggle and completing the sale opens no A4 print window. On a HARDWARE workspace both are still there, unchanged | P | Not Run |
| PROD-060 | Retail keeps the letterhead its quotations need (D163) | On a RETAIL workspace open Settings → Branding, then Layout, then Preview | Branding still offers logo, accent colour, signature and stamp; Layout shows the A4 page size, margins and column toggles **and** a “What prints on the bill” summary; Preview shows the bill preview with roll calibration **and** the A4 document chooser. The chooser offers Quotation, Return and Exchange but **not** Invoice / Bill | P | Not Run |
| PROD-061 | The bill change reaches retail and nobody else (D163) | Repeat PROD-059 and PROD-060 on a HARDWARE workspace and on a RESTAURANT one | Hardware is completely unchanged — A4 bill button, A4 payment toggle, A4 Layout, A4 Preview with Invoice / Bill. Restaurant is completely unchanged — no A4 anywhere, no letterhead controls, bill preview only | N | Not Run |
| PROD-062 | The bill preview shows the workspace's own trade (D164) | Settings → Preview on a RETAIL workspace; then on a RESTAURANT one | Retail's bill sample lists clothing and groceries (Cotton Shirt, Basmati Rice) with a discount and tax but **no service charge and no table number**; restaurant's still lists its menu WITH a service charge and table M1/04. Neither shows the other's | P | Not Run |
| PROD-063 | An unconfigured letterhead is neutral, never another trade (D164) | On a workspace with the Business name field left blank, Settings → Preview → Quotation; then set the Business name and refresh the preview | The blank case shows the tenant's registered name (or “Your Business” if it has none) and **never “Hardware POS”**; once a business name is saved, the preview shows that instead | P | Not Run |
| PROD-064 | The A4 preview shows the workspace's own trade (D165) | Settings → Preview → Quotation on a RETAIL workspace; then on a HARDWARE one; then on a GENERAL one | Retail lists clothing and groceries (Cotton Shirt, Basmati Rice) and **no** hardware goods; hardware lists exactly what it always did (Portland Cement, TMT Steel Bar, all eight, with their SKUs when the SKU column is on); general lists neutral “Standard Item” filler and neither trade | P | Not Run |
| PROD-065 | A vertical that declares no sample goods gets filler, not another trade (D165) | Inspect the preview on any workspace whose domain declares no `sampleItems` | “Standard Item 1”… with realistic prices, a pack line and the discount/tax rows — never another vertical's goods. This is the guard that stops the original defect being rebuilt one level down for every future vertical | N | Not Run |
| PROD-066 | ~~A same-product offer says how close it is, and still lets you pay (D166)~~ **SUPERSEDED by PROD-088 (D171)** | — | This case required Proceed to Payment to stay ENABLED at 5 units. D171 reverses that: an unfinished offer now blocks. Do not run this case — run PROD-088 | — | Superseded |
| PROD-067 | ~~A debt still blocks, and outranks the offer (D166/4.14)~~ **SUPERSEDED by PROD-090 (D171)** | — | This case required that with both offers live only the blocking notice shows — “one instruction at a time”. D171 makes both blocking, so both are named together. Run PROD-090 | — | Superseded |
| PROD-068 | The promotion name placeholder names no vertical (D166) | Products → Promotions → New, on a RETAIL workspace: read the Name field's placeholder | “e.g. Weekend Offer” — **not** “e.g. Lunch Bundle”, which is a restaurant example in a shared editor | P | Not Run |
| PROD-069 | A variant product never reads as single-variant while loading (D167) | Open a product with many variants (e.g. “Test”, 25 options). Watch the At-a-glance card as the page settles; then throttle the network and reload | It shows “Loading…” for Variants and Selling price, then “25 active” and a price range. It must **never** say “Single-variant product” or “Rs. 0.00” — those are the parent's legacy fields, which D44 says are not read once the product has variants | N | Not Run |
| PROD-070 | A failed variant fetch says so instead of inventing a shape (D167) | Open a variant product with the network blocked for `/products/:id/variants` (devtools request blocking) | Variants reads “Could not be loaded” with a hint to reload — not “Single-variant product”. Before D167 the failure was caught and returned an empty array, so it was indistinguishable from a genuine answer and never corrected | N | Not Run |
| PROD-071 | A genuinely single-variant product answers immediately (D167) | Open a product with no variants and watch the At-a-glance card from first paint | “Single-variant product” appears at once with its real price — no “Loading…”. The product payload already says the shape, so a simple product must not wait on a variant list it has no reason to care about | P | Not Run |
| SET-032 | The Preview tab shows one document at a time (D168) | RETAIL workspace → Settings → Preview | A segmented control reads **Printed bill** / **A4 documents**, with Printed bill chosen and the bill below it. The A4 chooser is NOT on screen underneath — before D168 both were stacked and reaching the quotation meant scrolling past a whole receipt | P | Not Run |
| SET-033 | The toggle swaps the document both ways (D168) | On that screen, click **A4 documents**, then **Printed bill** again | A4 documents shows the Document type chooser and the A4 sheet, with no bill; Printed bill brings the bill back and puts the chooser away. Arrow keys move between the two segments as well as clicking | P | Not Run |
| SET-034 | The A4 chooser keeps its document across a flip (D168) | Click **A4 documents**, set Document type to **Return / Refund**, click **Printed bill**, then **A4 documents** again | Still on Return / Refund. The panel is hidden, not thrown away, so comparing a return slip against the bill does not send you back to Quotation each time | P | Not Run |
| SET-035 | The choice survives leaving the tab (D168) | Click **A4 documents**, go to **Branding**, change nothing, come back to **Preview** | Still on A4 documents. The working loop is change the logo → look at the document → change it again; landing back on the bill each time would make that unusable | P | Not Run |
| SET-036 | Hardware and restaurant gain no toggle (D168) | Open Settings → Preview on a HARDWARE workspace, then on a RESTAURANT one | Neither shows a Printed bill / A4 documents control. Hardware still shows its A4 Document type chooser (with Invoice / Bill); the restaurant still shows its bill preview. A one-option toggle is a dead control | N | Not Run |
| PROD-072 | The overview names the product's category (D169) | Open a product that has a category (most seeded products do) → Overview → Product card | A **Category** row reads the category's name, and "Parent › Child" where a subcategory is set. Before D169 the page showed the id nowhere and the name nowhere | P | Not Run |
| PROD-073 | An uncategorised product says so immediately (D169) | Open a product with no category and watch the Product card from first paint | Category reads "—" at once — never "Loading…". The id arrives with the product, so a product with no category must not wait on a catalogue it has no use for | P | Not Run |
| PROD-074 | A slow catalogue does not read as "no category" (D169) | Open a product that HAS a category with `/categories` throttled or blocked (devtools) | Category reads "Loading…", then the name — or "Could not be loaded" if the request fails. It must **never** read "—", which is what an uncategorised product shows and would be a different, wrong fact | N | Not Run |
| PROD-075 | Business details render with the tenant's own labels (D169) | On a RETAIL workspace that has configured business details (Settings → Business details), open a product that has values recorded | A **Business details** card lists each field under the label the tenant typed, with the product's value. A boolean reads Yes / No — not blank, and not "false" | P | Not Run |
| PROD-076 | No empty Business details card (D169) | Open a product with nothing recorded; then open any product on a HARDWARE workspace | No Business details card at all in either case. Hardware's vertical declares no attributes, so the card would be permanently empty there | N | Not Run |
| PROD-077 | The overview shows what a product varies on (D169) | Open a product with variants (e.g. "Test", 25 options) → Overview | A **Variations** card lists each dimension (Size, Colour…) with its options as chips. Before D169 the dimensions were fetched on every page load and shown only inside the variant edit dialog | P | Not Run |
| PROD-078 | A failed variations fetch says so (D169) | Open a variant product with `/products/:id/variations` blocked | The Variations card reads "Could not be loaded. Reload the page to try again." — not an absent card, which would read as "this product varies on nothing" for a product whose payload says it has variants | N | Not Run |
| PROD-079 | Brand shows where a brand is set (D169) | Set a brand on a product via the API (`PATCH /products/:id` with `brandId`), then open it | A **Brand** row names the brand. On a product with no brand there is **no Brand row at all**. NOTE: no screen assigns a brand yet — the wizard has never sent `brandId` — so this needs the API call to observe | P | Not Run |
| PROD-080 | Opening stock actually lands (D170) | Add Product → a simple product (no variations) → Pricing & inventory: set a selling price, an **Opening quantity** of 12 and a cost, pick the **Opening stock branch**, save. Then open the product | Total stock reads 12. The **Inventory** tab shows 12 at that branch, the **Purchases** tab shows an opening receipt, and Average cost is the cost you entered. Before D170 the quantity was validated, shown on Review as "Opening stock", and then silently dropped — the product saved with zero stock | P | Not Run |
| PROD-081 | Opening stock asks where it lands (D170) | On that step, type an Opening quantity and try to continue without choosing a branch | An **Opening stock branch** selector appears as soon as the quantity is entered, and Continue is refused with "Pick where the opening stock lands." With the quantity blank, no selector appears at all | N | Not Run |
| PROD-082 | The SKU Generate button (D170) | On the same step, press **Generate** beside the SKU field | The field fills with the product name as a SKU plus a 3-character suffix (e.g. "Cement 50kg Bag" → `CEMENT-50KG-BAG-A7F`). It stays editable. Pressing it again gives a different suffix | P | Not Run |
| PROD-083 | A blank SKU is now allowed (D170) | Leave the SKU empty and save | The product saves. Before D170 the field carried a red asterisk AND a placeholder offering to generate one if left blank — neither half of which was true, since blank was refused and nothing generated anything | P | Not Run |
| PROD-084 | The SKU length cap survived (D170) | Paste 81 characters into the SKU field | "SKU is limited to 80 characters." Making SKU optional must not have removed the rule the server actually enforces | N | Not Run |
| PROD-085 | Cost and quantity precision (D170) | Enter a cost price of `4.567`, then an opening quantity of `12.3456` | Each is refused with "at most 2 / 3 decimal places". These values now travel to the receipt endpoint, whose line DTO is stricter than the product one; uncapped, the product would be created and then the receipt would 400 | N | Not Run |
| PROD-086 | Variant products still receive opening stock once (D170) | Create a product WITH variations, give two variants an opening quantity, pick the branch, save | Each variant's stock is what you entered — not doubled. The variants batch posts its own opening receipt, and the single-product path deliberately posts nothing for a variant product | N | Not Run |
| PROD-087 | The wizard counts its own steps (D170) | Walk through every step of Add Product on a RETAIL workspace, reading the small label above each heading | It reads "Step 1 of 5" … "Step 5 of 5", matching the dots above. Before D170 four of the five said "of 4" — D161 added Business details as a fifth step and only that step's label was computed. On a workspace whose domain declares no business details, the same walk reads "of 4" correctly | P | Not Run |
| PROD-088 | A same-product offer blocks until it is complete (D171) | RETAIL till: with a "buy 5 get 1" on ONE product, add 4 of it, then 5, then 6 | At 4 nothing. At **5** a 🎁 card names the offer, says "Add 1 <product> to complete this offer" and **Proceed to Payment is DISABLED** with "Payment is unavailable until the offer is complete." At 6 the card goes, the discount applies and payment is enabled. This REVERSES PROD-066 (D166), which required payment to stay enabled at 5 | N | Not Run |
| PROD-089 | The notice is identical for both shapes (D171) | Compare the card at 5 units of a same-product offer against the card for a "buy 2 shirts get 1 tie" with 2 shirts and no tie | Same 🎁, same "Add N ... to complete this offer" sentence, same "Payment is unavailable" line, same colour. The point of D171 is that a cashier cannot tell the two kinds apart, because they now require the same thing | P | Not Run |
| PROD-090 | Both offers are named when both are short (D171) | Have a same-product offer AND a cross-product offer both incomplete in one basket | The card lists **both**, each with its own 🎁 and name. D166 hid the same-product one while a debt was live; hiding one now would leave the cashier completing an offer and finding payment still blocked with no reason shown | P | Not Run |
| PROD-091 | A small basket is not held hostage (D171) | With a "buy 5 get 1" live, add just 1 or 2 units and try to pay | No card, payment enabled. The customer has qualified for nothing, so there is nothing to complete. If this blocks, D171 has been over-applied and every small sale in the shop is refused | N | Not Run |
| PROD-092 | The count is right, not always "one" (D171) | With a "buy 2 get 2" offer, put exactly 2 in the basket | "Add **2** <product>s to complete this offer" — two, plural. A till that always said "1" passed every other case here until this one was added | P | Not Run |
| PROD-093 | ACCEPTED COST — exactly five cannot be sold (D171) | With "buy 5 get 1", a customer who wants exactly 5 and refuses the free 6th | The sale **cannot be completed** at 5. This is the decision, not a defect: the cashier must add the 6th (which is free) or remove one to sell 4. Recorded so it is not re-filed as a bug | N | Not Run |
| PROD-094 | A menu item must name the station that prepares it (D152) | On a restaurant tenant, create a product and try to continue past step 3 without choosing a kitchen station; then do the same on a hardware tenant | The restaurant wizard blocks with a message naming what to do; the hardware wizard has no such field and is never blocked by it | P | Not Run |
| PROD-095 | Main is preselected, and a real choice is not overridden (D152) | Open step 3 on a restaurant product; then pick Grill and let the step reload | Main is ticked when nothing was chosen, so the requirement is never an obstacle. Once Grill is picked it stays picked, and clearing every station and saving really does clear the links | P | Not Run |

| PIMP-018 | A blank column does NOT erase stored details (D189) | On a product that already has business details, import a sheet matching it by SKU with the detail columns **left blank** | The product keeps its existing business details. Blank means "this sheet says nothing", not "clear them" — sending an empty document would wipe them under D64's replace semantics | N | Not Run |

## EXC — Exchanges

> **Status: the Exchange transaction exists (D128, Phase 7). D2's "not implemented" caveat is lifted (D128b).**
>
> An `Exchange` row links a **return leg** (`returnId`, required) and a **replacement
> sale leg** (`replacementSaleId`, nullable) against an `originalSaleId`, numbered
> `X-000001` from `DocumentSequence`. `POST /v1/exchanges` (module `EXCHANGES`,
> permissions `return:create` **and** `sale:create`) runs the return through
> `ReturnsService`, then drafts and completes the replacement through `SalesService`;
> it computes no prices, moves no stock and writes no payment of its own — the two
> legs do. Settlement is **gross** (D128a): the return refunds by `refundMethod`
> (default CASH) and `payments` must cover the replacement in full, so an even swap

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| EXC-D-001 | Exchange A4 document renders | Settings → document preview → type "Exchange" | A4 note renders with returned + replacement lines and a net difference | P | Passed |
| EXC-D-002 | Returned lines are negative, replacements positive | Preview an exchange with both line kinds | Returned lines prefixed "Return:" and negated; replacements prefixed "New:" | P | Passed |
| EXC-D-003 | Exchange document honours letterhead settings | Change logo/accent/margins, re-preview | Exchange doc reflects the same document settings as invoice/quotation | P | Passed |
| EXC-D-004 | Signature blocks present on the exchange doc | Preview exchange | Same signature chain as other document types (see DOC-014) | P | Passed |
| EXC-D-005 | Several lines come back in one exchange (D194) | On a sale with three lines, tick two, choose a replacement for each, complete | ONE exchange number, one return and one replacement sale covering both lines. Before D194 the screen offered radio buttons, so this took two separate exchanges | P | Not Run |
| EXC-D-006 | Part of a line comes back (D194) | On a line bought ×3, tick it and set the quantity to 2 | Two come back and two go out; one stays with the customer. The old screen always returned `availableReturnQuantity`, so this could not be expressed at all | P | Not Run |
| EXC-D-007 | Every line needs its own answer (D194) | Tick two lines, choose a replacement for one only | Complete is disabled and the screen says a replacement is needed for every line. The money box does not show a difference — a half-filled basket showing a plausible total is how the wrong money gets taken | N | Not Run |
| EXC-D-008 | An empty basket cannot be completed (D194) | Untick everything | Complete is disabled. `[].every(...)` is true, so without an explicit rule this state would offer to complete an exchange of nothing | N | Not Run |
| EXC-D-009 | Approval is judged on the whole basket (D194) | As a cashier with a refund limit, tick lines that individually sit under it but together exceed it | The manager PIN is demanded once, for the combined basket. Served as two exchanges each could slip under the limit separately | N | Not Run |
| EXC-D-010 | The quantity cannot exceed what is left (D194) | Type a number larger than the line's remaining quantity, or paste text | Clamped to the available quantity; text becomes 0. The server is never asked to refuse a number the screen offered | N | Not Run |
| EXC-T-001 | Create an exchange transaction | Completed sale of one Medium → sale detail → Exchange (`/exchanges/new?saleId=`) → choose the returned item, choose the Large at the same price as replacement → Complete exchange | 201 from POST /v1/exchanges with `exchangeNumber` X-000001, `returnedValue` = `replacementValue`, `netDifference` 0 and `complete` true; a Return R-… and a Sale S-… exist and are linked; the page reads "Both legs completed." with "Refunded to customer" and "Charged for replacement"; GET /v1/exchanges lists it and another tenant cannot read it by id | P | Not Run |
| EXC-T-002 | Exchange adjusts stock for returned and replacement items | Medium and Large both at 10; exchange one Medium for one Large; replay the identical request with the same `Idempotency-Key` | Medium 11 and Large 9, each moved exactly once with its own `StockMovement`; the replay returns the SAME exchange (same id and number), refunds nothing again and moves no stock; the body field `idempotencyKey` behaves like the header | P | Not Run |
| EXC-T-003 | Exchange with a net amount due collects payment | Returned Medium 1,000, replacement Large 1,500, `payments` CASH 1,500, `refundMethod` left default | The return refunds 1,000 CASH and the sale is paid 1,500 in full — gross settlement (D128a), never netted through store credit; `netDifference` 500 and the page reads "Customer paid extra"; a `payments` total short of the replacement is refused by the sale path exactly as an ordinary sale | P | Not Run |
| EXC-T-004 | Exchange with a net refund issues a refund | Returned 1,500, replacement 1,000, CASH 1,000; then repeat on a walk-in sale with `refundMethod` STORE_CREDIT | 1,500 refunded on the return leg, 1,000 charged, `netDifference` −500 and "Customer got back"; the store-credit attempt is refused "Store credit requires a saved customer…" and a cash refund can never exceed what the original sale paid — the return leg keeps every ReturnsService rule | P | Not Run |
| EXC-T-005 | Exchange pushes the correct QuickBooks document(s) | — | Premise contradicted by D120/D128: retail tenants run `AccountingProviderKind.NONE` and `ExchangesService` writes nothing accounting-side; the legs are an ordinary Return and Sale, so any QuickBooks behaviour belongs to RET-014/RET-015 and QB-*, not to an exchange case | P | Blocked — out of scope (D120/D128) |
| EXC-T-006 | Exchange requires a permission (`exchange:create`) | POST /v1/exchanges as a role holding `return:create` but not `sale:create`, then the reverse; open a completed sale as each | 403 both ways — D128 mints no `exchange:create`; the route requires BOTH `RETURN_CREATE` and `SALE_CREATE`, and the sale detail shows the Exchange button only to a user holding both ("You need permission to take returns and to make sales." otherwise) | N | Not Run |
| EXC-T-007 | Exchange is hidden for Restaurant tenants | Restaurant tenant: POST /v1/exchanges, POST /v1/exchanges/preview and /exchanges/new by URL | 403 "Feature not available" on every route (`EXCHANGES` is absent from `FOOD_SERVICE_MODULES`); no Exchange button on any restaurant screen; a retail tenant with an explicit `EXCHANGES` revocation is refused the same way | N | Not Run |
| EXC-T-008 | A size swap needs no manager PIN (D130) | Sale of ONE shirt; exchange it for another size as owner or cashier with no approval token | POST /v1/exchanges/preview reports `requiresApproval` false and the completion succeeds without a token although the whole sale is being returned | P | Not Run |
| EXC-T-009 | The waiver is scoped to exchanges (D130) | The same single-line sale: POST /v1/returns/preview, then complete a standalone full return without a token; then POST /v1/returns with an extra `withinExchange: true` field | Preview lists the reason "Full-sale return"; completion is 403 `ReturnApprovalRequired` "This return requires manager approval"; the extra field is not a DTO field and changes nothing — only `ExchangesService` can set the flag | N | Not Run |
| EXC-T-010 | Every other trigger still fires inside an exchange (D130) | Exchange where the returned item's condition is DAMAGED; then approve with a manager PIN (POST /returns/approve) and retry with the token | First refused 403 with reason "A returned item is damaged, opened, or used" and the page asks for a manager PIN; with the token the same exchange completes; outside-period, over-limit, credit-customer and refund-method triggers behave the same | N | Not Run |
| EXC-T-011 | A failed replacement leaves a recoverable exchange (D128) | Complete with a `replacementItems` variant id that is not this tenant's | The request fails, but the exchange row exists with `replacementSaleId` null, `complete` false, `replacementValue` and `netDifference` null; the return has already refunded the customer; the returned size is back on the shelf and the replacement never moved; the page reads "The replacement did not complete." and the operator can ring the replacement up as an ordinary sale | N | Not Run |
| EXC-T-012 | The exchange note ties to the money that moved (D128) | Print the A4 note for an upgrade exchange (1,000 → 1,500) and for a downgrade | Note carries the X-number, "Return:" rows negated and "New:" rows positive with a real per-line tax figure on both sides, and "Balance due from customer" 500.00 read from `Return.refundTotal` and `Sale.total`, not summed from display rows; the downgrade reads "Refund to customer"; an exchange with no replacement still renders | P | Not Run |

## QUO — Quotations

| CUST-032 | Row click respects what it lands on | Click the name link, the Edit link, and the credit info icon | Each does its own thing; no double navigation | P | Not Run |

## DOC — Documents & Printing

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DOC-001 | Sale A4 document renders | Open printable invoice for a sale | Items, totals, payments, letterhead correct | P | Not Run |
| DOC-002 | Customer block composes address | Sale for customer with street/city/state/zip/country | One joined "Bill to" address line; company + tax no. shown | P | Not Run |
| DOC-003 | Walk-in shows placeholder party | Sale without customer | "Walk-in customer" block | P | Not Run |
| DOC-004 | Return document | Print a completed return | Refund lines and totals correct | P | Not Run |
| DOC-005 | Quotation PDF via server | Download PDF | Generated (Puppeteer/Chromium) with valid layout | P | Not Run |
| DOC-006 | Tax number visibility toggle | Disable customer tax display setting | Tax number omitted from party block | P | Not Run |
| DOC-007 | Documents print light theme | Print from dark mode | White page, light tokens forced | P | Not Run |
| DOC-008 | Receipt for reprint | Reprint receipt from sale detail | Server receipt printed for a COMPLETED, REFUNDED or VOIDED sale; a refusal is shown on the page (see DOC-021) — the client-HTML fallback applies only to the first print from the till | P | Not Run |
| DOC-009 | Receipt record per sale + mark printed | Complete sale; GET /receipts/sale/:id; mark printed | Receipt exists; status flips to PRINTED | P | Not Run |
| DOC-010 | Attach customer to a receipt | POST /receipts/:saleId/customer | Customer linked for the reprint | P | Not Run |
| DOC-011 | Document template preview from settings | Settings → preview / sample PDF | Sample renders with current letterhead/toggles | P | Not Run |
| DOC-012 | Four signature placeholders render | Enable signature fields, open any document | Authorized signature, Checked by, Approved by, Customer signature — in that order | P | Passed |
| DOC-013 | Signature toggle hides all four | Disable signature fields, open a document | No sign-off row at all | N | Passed |
| DOC-014 | Signature chain on every doc type | Open quotation, invoice, return, exchange | All four blocks present on each | P | Passed |
| DOC-015 | Signature row fits A4 width | Print a document with signature fields on | Four equal columns on one row, no wrap or overflow | P | Not Run |
| DOC-016 | Uploaded signature/stamp fit their column | Upload a wide signature image, print | Image scales to column width, does not overlap "Checked by" | P | Not Run |
| DOC-017 | A label sheet is a print job with no sale (D127) | POST /v1/labels/preview then /v1/labels/print with `labels:[{variantId, quantity:12}]`, `copies:2`; GET /v1/print-jobs, then `?saleId=<a sale>`; reprint a receipt | Preview returns HTML with 12 cells and an empty `skipped`; print queues a `PRODUCT_LABEL` job with `saleId` null, `copies` 2, status PENDING, that a print agent can mark printed; it is absent from the sale-scoped query; the receipt job still carries its `saleId` and behaves as before | P | Not Run |
| DOC-018 | Unprintable labels are reported, never silently dropped (D125/D127) | Print labels for a variant with a wrong-check-digit EAN-13, one with no barcode, one valid, and one from another workspace; then a sheet of only unprintable ones | `skipped` names each with a reason: "…is not a valid EAN-13 — most likely a wrong check digit. Reissue it under Barcodes before printing." / "No barcode. Generate one before printing EAN-13 labels." / "That variant does not belong to this workspace."; the valid one prints; the all-unprintable sheet is refused 400 `NO_PRINTABLE_LABELS` and no job is queued | N | Not Run |
| DOC-019 | Receipt and invoice show the tax breakdown and the promotion (D122/D123) | Print the A4 invoice and thermal receipt for a sale with an 18% line, a zero-rated line and a BOGO free tie; then for a sale where every line shares one rate | Every renderer names the line "Cotton T-Shirt (M — Navy)"; the tax breakdown lists "18%" and "0%" rows summing exactly to the recorded tax and is absent for the single-rate sale; the tie line reads "Promotion: <name>" and the summary shows "Promotions" separately from the manual discount; both documents agree | P | Not Run |
| DOC-020 | A return document refunds the tax the line paid (D122) | Return the zero-rated line, then the taxable line, of the mixed sale above; print each return document; also return a line from a sale predating per-line rates | The zero-rated refund carries no tax and the taxable one carries its full share — no proration between them; `ReturnItem.taxRatePercent` stores the reversed rate and a rate change between sale and return alters nothing; the pre-snapshot sale falls back to proportional refunding unchanged | P | Not Run |
| DOC-021 | A returned or voided sale keeps its receipt; a void says so (5.10) | Fully refund a sale, then reprint it from the sale page; set another sale to VOIDED (no void endpoint exists yet — database only) and reprint; try a held (DRAFT) basket | The refunded sale's receipt reprints unchanged; the voided one carries VOID across its head and "This sale was voided. Not valid as proof of purchase."; the draft is refused with "This sale is still on hold and has taken no payment, so it has no receipt yet." and its page offers no Reprint button — no runtime overlay | P | Not Run |
| DOC-022 | The 80mm receipt prints no SKU; the A4 column is a setting (5.10) | Print an 80mm receipt for a sale with SKU'd items; preview the A4 invoice on a NEW workspace, then toggle Settings → Documents → "Product SKU column" | No SKU line under any item on the receipt; the A4 shows no SKU column until the toggle is on; an existing workspace that stored `showSku: true` keeps its column; the sale's frozen receipt content still holds the SKU (reprint data is unchanged) | N | Not Run |
| DOC-050 | The receipt shows cash received and change (D183) | POS → a sale totalling e.g. Rs 2,478 → Cash → type **5,000** in Amount Received → Complete Payment → print the thermal receipt | The bill shows **Cash received Rs. 5,000.00** and **Change Rs. 2,522.00**, in ADDITION to Total / Paid / Balance. Before D183 the tender was discarded at the till and the paper showed only Paid 2,478 / Balance 0.00 | P | Not Run |
| DOC-051 | Exact money prints no change rows (D183) | Same sale, type the exact total (or press **Exact**), complete, print | **No** Cash received or Change rows. “Change Rs. 0.00” on every cash receipt is a row the cashier has to read past every time | N | Not Run |
| DOC-052 | An under-tender is a balance, not change (D183) | Take a PARTIAL payment below the total, complete, print | Paid and Balance show the real figures; **no** Change row, and no negative number anywhere | N | Not Run |
| DOC-053 | Paid and Balance are unchanged by the tender (D183) | On the DOC-050 sale, open the sale in Sales, and check the customer's credit | Paid **2,478**, Balance **0.00**, and the customer owes **nothing**. If the customer appears to owe 2,522, the tender has been written into `balanceAmount` and the debtors list is corrupted | N | Not Run |
| DOC-054 | The drawer total is not inflated (D183) | After DOC-050, open the dashboard's payment-method breakdown for today | Cash for that sale counts **2,478**, not 5,000. The 2,522 was handed back and never entered the drawer | N | Not Run |
| DOC-055 | A reprint keeps the tender (D186) | Reprint the DOC-050 receipt from Sales history, then reprint it a SECOND time | Both show **Cash** and **Balance** with the original figures. D183 recorded this as impossible without a migration; it was not — the first print already stored the number in `Receipt.content`, and the reprint was erasing it. A receipt printed BEFORE D183 still shows nothing, which is correct | P | Not Run |
| DOC-056 | Other documents are unaffected (D183) | Print a restaurant bill, and a card-paid retail receipt | Both render exactly as before — neither sends a tender, so neither gains a row | N | Not Run |
| DOC-057 | The receipt shows four rows, nothing repeated (D185) | Print a cash receipt with change (DOC-050) and count the money rows | Exactly **Total / Cash / Balance / Status**. No `Paid` row, no `Balance Rs. 0.00`, and the total appears **once** — before D185 it appeared three times (Total, Paid and a trailing Cash payment row) | P | Not Run |
| DOC-058 | A split tender keeps its full breakdown (D185) | Pay a sale with Card + Cash together | `Paid` / `Balance` and BOTH method rows are printed. The four-row layout is only for a single cash payment, because on a split the change is not tender minus total | N | Not Run |
| DOC-059 | A retail till offers only the receipt (D187) | RETAIL workspace → POS → complete a payment and read the dialog | **Print receipt** is the single, primary print button. No **Print A4 Bill**, no **Preview A4 Bill**. Before D187 the A4 pair was primary and the receipt was a small text link between them | N | Not Run |
| DOC-060 | A hardware till keeps both A4 actions (D187) | Same on a HARDWARE workspace | **Preview A4 Bill** and **Print A4 Bill** are both there, with the thermal receipt as the secondary link. D163 took the A4 from retail only | P | Not Run |
| DOC-061 | The receipt prints itself after payment (D187) | RETAIL, with *Print receipt after payment* ON, complete a sale | The thermal receipt prints on its own, as the A4 does on hardware. Before D187 the auto-print was gated on the A4 existing, so a retail sale printed **nothing** | P | Not Run |
| DOC-062 | The toggle names the right bill and still works (D187) | Read the toggle on retail, then on hardware; turn it off and complete a sale | Retail reads *Print receipt after payment*, hardware *Print A4 bill after payment*. With it off, nothing prints automatically on either | P | Not Run |
| DOC-063 | The receipt uses the standard money labels (D188) | Print any retail thermal receipt and read the money rows | **Bill Amount**, **Paid Amount**, **Bal. Amount** — the same words the restaurant bill has always used. Not Total / Paid / Balance | P | Not Run |
| DOC-064 | The payment breakdown keeps its method names (D188) | Print a receipt settled by card, or split card + cash | The breakdown rows still read **Card** and **Cash**. Those name a METHOD, not an amount, and renaming them would turn a method into a total | N | Not Run |
| DOC-065 | The quotation letterhead shows the logo (D193) | Settings → upload a logo, then open a quotation and click Print | The logo prints on the letterhead. Before D193 the `<img>` was emitted with a `/uploads/…` src, which the print popup resolved against the WEB app and got a 404 — a broken image, not a missing one | P | Not Run |
| DOC-066 | Signature and stamp print too (D193) | Upload a signature and a stamp, then print a quotation | All three images appear. They shared the logo's defect on the same letterhead and were fixed with it | P | Not Run |
| DOC-067 | The thermal bill shows the logo above the shop name (D193) | With a logo configured, complete a sale and print the bill | The logo prints, and the shop NAME is still printed under it. A roll is monochrome; a logo that replaced the name would leave nothing identifying the shop when the image prints badly | P | Not Run |
| DOC-068 | A workspace with no logo prints exactly as before (D193) | On a workspace with no logo uploaded, print a bill and a quotation | No image element at all, business name intact. This is every tenant until someone uploads one | N | Not Run |
| DOC-069 | A document still prints when the image cannot be read (D193) | Stop the storage service (or remove the uploaded file), then print a bill and a quotation | Both print without the picture. Branding is decoration — a receipt is the record of money that already moved, and a quotation that 500s over a logo is the worse outcome | N | Not Run |
| DOC-070 | The printed document opens on another machine (D193) | Print a quotation to PDF, then open it on a machine that cannot reach this server | The logo is still there. Images are inlined as `data:` URIs rather than URLs, because a quotation gets emailed and a recipient resolving `localhost:4000` finds their own machine | P | Not Run |
| DOC-071 | The refund slip shows the logo (D195) | With a logo configured, complete a return and print the slip | The logo prints above the shop name, and the name is still printed. D193 covered the sales bill and the A4 and missed this renderer — the one a customer keeps as proof the shop took the goods back | P | Not Run |
| DOC-072 | The refund slip is unchanged without a logo (D195) | Print a refund slip on a workspace with no logo uploaded | No image element, shop name intact, every figure unchanged | N | Not Run |
| DOC-073 | The RETURN / REFUND stamp survives the logo (D195) | Print a refund slip with a logo configured | The stamp is still the loudest thing on the page. A refund slip mistaken for a sales receipt can be presented as proof of purchase | N | Not Run |

| OTBL-015 | Last bill frees the shared table | Close party B's bill | Table returns to Available automatically | P | Passed |
| OTBL-016 | Billing reminder appears | Close a bill leaving tables held by another party | Dialog lists each table + who holds it, offers Unreserve, then Continue to bill | P | Passed |

| OTBL-023 | A member table is not offered to a second open table (D105) | With M2 and M3 joined and in service, open the New open table picker | M2 and M3 are absent from the picker; AVAILABLE tables only | N | Not Run |

## KIT — Kitchen Board (D68 / D100 / D111–D116 / D142)

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| KIT-001 | Tickets age on the board (D100) | Leave a ticket outstanding past 10 and then 15 minutes | Timer turns amber at 10 min and red at 15 with the card border; completed tickets stop ageing | P | Not Run |
| KIT-002 | A wrong bump can be taken back (D100) | Mark a ticket done, then Reopen it | It returns to the outstanding tab; POST …/kitchen-tickets/:id/reopen needs the same permission as completing | P | Not Run |
| KIT-003 | The board rings for a ticket it has not seen (D111) | Place an order while the kitchen board is open; re-poll without new tickets | One chime on arrival, silence on re-polls; the kitchen SCREEN is the only one that sounds — the tables screen and the orders queue stay silent (D118) — whoever is looking at it, the till's read-only board included | P | Not Run |
| KIT-004 | Start preparing, then done (D113) | Tap Start on a queued ticket, then Mark done | Ticket moves QUEUED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED; the orders queue's unified status follows (Preparing, then Ready); POST …/kitchen-tickets/:id/start needs the same permission as completing | P | Not Run |
| KIT-005 | Three lanes, each ticket in exactly one (D115/D116) | Read the board with queued, preparing and done tickets | To make · Preparing · Done; a cancelled order's ticket leaves the pass, and there is no Cancel on the board — cancelling belongs to the orders queue | P | Not Run |
| KIT-006 | Recall lands on To make (D100/D113) | Mark an IN_PROGRESS ticket done, then Reopen; try Reopen on a ticket that is still preparing | Reopen returns a done ticket to To make (QUEUED), never to Preparing; a preparing ticket has no Reopen and the call is a no-op; the till (KOT_VIEW only) sees neither Start nor Mark done | P | Not Run |
| KIT-007 | The Done lane holds today only (D142) | With tickets bumped yesterday and today, open the board's Done tab; then change the workspace timezone in Settings → Business and reload | Only today's bumped tickets are listed, newest first; the day is the SHOP's (the lane's contents follow the configured timezone, not the tablet's clock); the empty lane reads "Nothing finished today yet. Earlier tickets are in Ticket history." | P | Not Run |
| KIT-013 | Recall reaches today only (D100/D142) | Bump a ticket, then open Done and use Recall; separately, look for a Recall control on a ticket bumped before the shop's midnight (on the Done lane and in Ticket history) | Today's bump can still be recalled from the lane; an older one offers no Recall anywhere — the history is a record and carries no verbs, so stale work is never re-queued onto the pass | N | Not Run |
| KIT-014 | The rail marks one place at a time (D142a) | Open Kitchen, then Ticket history; look at the rail in both | Exactly one entry is highlighted and carries aria-current="page" each time — on /kitchen/history that is Ticket history, and Kitchen is NOT also lit | N | Not Run |
| KIT-015 | A history row carries both ends of the ticket (D142a) | Open Ticket history and read a finished row | Started shows when the ticket reached the kitchen, Finished when it was bumped, and the turnaround reads under the finish ("25 min on the pass"); a row with no finish shows no turnaround | P | Not Run |
| KIT-016 | A history record opens the whole order (D142a) | Click a history row, and separately tab to the ticket number and press Enter; then press Escape | Both open the same dialog showing EVERY item the table ordered across stations and rounds — quantities, variants, modifiers and special instructions — not just this ticket's station share; Escape closes it; a click that ends a text selection does not open it | P | Not Run |
| KIT-017 | Every lane chip carries its count (D142b) | With work queued, work started and tickets bumped today, read the three chips from To make, then from Preparing, then from Done | All three chips show a number on every tab — To make, Preparing and Done — and each matches the list that lane shows when opened | P | Not Run |
| KIT-018 | The chips move with a bump, not with the poll (D142b) | Press Start preparing, then Mark done, watching the chips | To make and Preparing change immediately, without waiting for the five-second refresh; Done's number follows on the next poll | P | Not Run |
| KIT-019 | An order is grouped by the station that cooks it (D152) | Send a round whose items belong to several stations — a curry, a fried rice and something off the grill — and watch the kitchen board | One card per STATION, each carrying only that station's dishes. Every dish of the round is on exactly one card: none is missing and none appears twice | P | Not Run |
| KIT-020 | An unlinked dish reaches the kitchen at Main (D152) | At a branch with several stations, create a product WITHOUT choosing a station (or use one whose station was archived, or one linked only to another branch's station), order it and send the round | The dish is on a card for the Main station. Before D152 the first case reached no card at all and the other two reached a card no chip on that board could select | P | Not Run |
| KIT-021 | The board and the history name the station (D152) | Read a board card, its Details dialog, the ticket-history table and its search box | The card carries a ribbon naming its station with the round at the far end; each item line in the dialog names its station; the history has a Station column and searching a station name matches | P | Not Run |
| KIT-022 | Tickets cut during the D147 window name no station | Query a KitchenTicket row written between D147 and D152 and open it on the board and the history | It carries a NULL station and is shown as such — the ribbon carries the round alone, the history prints an em dash, the dialog leaves the line unlabelled. None of them invents "Main", because that ticket really did hold every station's items | P | Not Run |
| KIT-023 | The ticket history holds every lane (D150) | With work queued, work started and work bumped, open Ticket history | All three appear. A To make and a Preparing ticket each show their lane badge, a dash under Finished and a dash under By; a bumped one shows its finish stamp and the time it spent on the pass | P | Not Run |
| KIT-024 | Unfinished work sorts to the top (D150) | On a branch with several pending and several finished tickets, read the first page | Pending tickets come first, newest-raised first, then finished ones newest-finished first. Paging forward and back never repeats or skips a row | P | Not Run |
| KIT-025 | Cancelled work still stays out, in every lane (D115/D150) | Cancel a round, an order, and a takeaway whose ticket was never bumped; open Ticket history | None of the three appears, even though they are no longer excluded by being unfinished. The cancelled filter on the board still shows them | P | Not Run |
| KIT-026 | The station filter cuts the board and the chime (D152) | On a multi-station branch pick a station chip, bump work at another station, then reload the page | The board shows only that station's cards, its choice survives the reload, and the chime stays silent for other stations. Each chip still counts its own station across the lane, so no chip reads zero while that station holds work | P | Not Run |
| KIT-027 | Main is created when it is needed (D152) | On a branch that has never had a Main station, send a round containing an unlinked dish | A station coded MAIN named "Main" appears and the dish is on its card. Sending a second such round creates no duplicate | P | Not Run |
| KIT-028 | A kitchen ticket prints from its card (D153) | Press Print on a card on the kitchen board | The print dialog opens with a ticket carrying the KOT number on the left and the date and time on the right, the table name (or Takeaway), then Item No. / Item Name / Qty. It prints in the same font as the bill, and no heading, customer name or "Total Items" appears | P | Not Run |
| KIT-029 | Modifiers and instructions print under their dish (D153) | Print a ticket for a round containing a customised dish with a variation, addons and a special instruction | Each appears directly under that dish, not at the foot of the ticket: the variation and addons on one line, the instruction marked and set apart. A dish with nothing to add carries no blank line | P | Not Run |
| KIT-030 | Printing changes nothing (D153) | Press Print on a queued card, then on a done card | The card stays exactly where it was in its lane, no dialog opens and no status changes. Each card's Print button prints THAT card's ticket, not the first on the board | P | Not Run |
| KIT-031 | The board stops polling when nobody is looking (D154) | Open the kitchen board, switch to another tab for a minute, then come back. Watch the network panel | No requests while the tab is hidden, and one immediately on return rather than a wait for the next tick. Switching windows away and back does the same | P | Not Run |
| KIT-032 | A tick costs one request (D154) | Watch the network panel with the board open and visible | One request per five seconds, not two. The lane chips still carry their numbers on every lane, and the numbers agree with the cards | P | Not Run |
| KIT-033 | A failed poll keeps the pass working (D154) | With the board loaded, take the API offline for one tick, then restore it | The cards and the chips stay on screen under an error banner, not a blank board. The banner clears on the next good poll. Switching lanes while offline shows the error card instead, never the previous lane's cards relabelled | P | Not Run |
| KIT-034 | Every lane chip carries its number under a station cut (D174) | On a multi-station branch, pick a station chip and read all three lane chips from each lane in turn | To make, Preparing and Done each show a number on every lane, and the number is THAT station's — bumping a ticket at another station does not move it. Switch back to All stations and the branch-wide numbers return | P | Not Run |
| KIT-035 | The station strip still counts every station under a cut (D174) | With work at two stations, pick one station chip and read the strip | The other station's chip still shows its own count rather than zero; the cards show only the chosen station's work | P | Not Run |
| KIT-036 | The ticket history filters by station and table (D175) | Open Ticket history, press Filters, tick a station, then also tick a table; then press Clear | The panel shows a Station group and a Table group of chips; the button badge counts the active filters; the list narrows to tickets matching BOTH; the page returns to one on every change; Clear empties both | P | Not Run |
| KIT-037 | Searching a station or table name no longer matches (D175) | Type a station name, then a table name, then a dish name into the history search | The first two match nothing; the dish still matches. The search box says it searches ticket, order and dish | P | Not Run |
| KIT-038 | Takeaway is never a table chip (D175) | On a branch that has taken a takeaway order, open the history Filters panel | No "Walk In" or delivery group appears among the tables; takeaway tickets are listed only while no table filter is set | P | Not Run |
| KIT-039 | Orders and tickets number independently (D176) | Note the last RO- and KOT- numbers, send a round spanning two stations, then place a new order | The two tickets are consecutive KOT numbers; the order counter has not moved for them; the new order is the next RO number after the last order, not after the last ticket | P | Not Run |
| KIT-040 | The first ticket after the upgrade does not collide (D176) | On a tenant that already holds tickets minted from the old shared stream, send a round | The round succeeds and its ticket takes the number after the highest existing KOT, never KOT-000001 again | P | Not Run |
| KIT-041 | A round is called a send on every screen (D177) | Send three rounds for one table; read the board card, its Details dialog, the ticket history, the bill sheet, the session sheet and a printed KOT | Each says "1st send", "2nd send", "3rd send" and none says "Round". On a table with eleven or more sends the labels read 11th, 12th, 13th | P | Not Run |
| KIT-042 | The KOT number is always fully visible (D177) | Open the kitchen board at 1024, 1280 and 1920 px wide with cards holding short and long content | The full KOT number shows on every card at every width. Below 1024 the Print and Details buttons show icons only and remain usable; the board never shows more than three columns | P | Not Run |
| KIT-008 | Yesterday's tickets are in the history, and so are today's (D142) | Open Ticket history from the rail, and from the "Older tickets" link on the Done lane | Both reach /kitchen/history; the list holds the ticket bumped yesterday AND the one bumped minutes ago, newest first, with where it went, its items, its station, when it was finished and by whom | P | Not Run |
| KIT-009 | Ticket history pages and searches on the server (D142) | With more than one page of finished tickets: change the rows-per-page, go to page 2, then search a dish name, a ticket number and a table code | Each request carries page/pageSize/search to GET …/kitchen-tickets/history; searching returns to page 1; a term with a double space still matches; a term that matches nothing reads "No tickets match “…”" rather than the empty-branch wording | P | Not Run |
| KIT-010 | Cancelled work is in neither the lane nor the history (D115/D142) | Cancel an order whose ticket was already bumped; check the Done lane and Ticket history | The ticket appears in neither; it remains visible on the board's Cancelled lane | N | Not Run |
| KIT-011 | Kitchen staff get the board and its history, and no dashboard (D142) | Sign in as kitchen staff; read the rail; press Ctrl+K; then open /dashboard directly | The rail is exactly Kitchen · Ticket history; the palette offers Open ticket history and not Go to dashboard; /dashboard redirects to /kitchen instead of showing the floor | N | Not Run |
| KIT-012 | Every other restaurant role keeps the dashboard (D142) | Sign in as the restaurant owner, a waiter and the till; read the rail and open /dashboard | All three keep the Dashboard entry and the service dashboard renders for each — the gate is TABLE_VIEW / SALE_READ / REPORT_READ, not a role name | P | Not Run |

## BSPL — Bill Splitting by Item (D51)

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| BSPL-001 | Bill shows its line items | Open a closed tab's bill | Items card lists each line with qty × unit price and line total | P | Passed |
| BSPL-002 | Split by item creates a bill per guest | Assign lines to 2+ guests, Create bills | One split per guest, each listing its own items | P | Passed |
| BSPL-003 | Shares sum to the bill total exactly | Compare Σ split shares to the total | Equal to the cent, including non-divisible totals | P | Passed |
| BSPL-004 | A multi-unit line splits across guests | 3 × item assigned 2/1 to two guests | Each guest billed for their units only | P | Passed |
| BSPL-005 | Service charge shared pro rata | Split a bill carrying a service charge | Each share = own items + proportional charge | P | Passed |
| BSPL-006 | Partial assignment refused | Save with items unassigned | 400 naming the item and the shortfall; UI disables Create | N | Passed |
| BSPL-007 | Foreign item refused | Assign an orderItemId from another bill | 400 "not on this bill" | N | Passed |
| BSPL-008 | Payment allocates to its split | Collect for one split | That split's Paid rises; bill Paid rises; others unchanged | P | Passed |
| BSPL-009 | Overpaying a split refused | Pay more than a split's remaining | 400 naming the split balance | N | Passed |
| BSPL-010 | Re-split refused after payment | Split a bill that has a payment | 400 — reopen or refund first | N | Passed |
| BSPL-011 | Paying all splits settles the bill | Collect each split in turn | Bill reaches PAID with paid == total | P | Passed |
| BSPL-012 | Per-split printable bill | Click Print on a split | Print window shows that guest's items and amount only | P | Not Run |
| BSPL-013 | Amount-based splitting still works | Use "By amount" | Existing even/arbitrary split unchanged | P | Not Run |
| BSPL-014 | Permission gate | Role without bill:split | No split controls; POST 403 | N | Not Run |

## STK — Stock takes (D132)

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| STK-001 | A count sets the shelf figure, down or up (D132) | Open /stock-takes by URL (the rail entry was removed 2026-09-08) as Owner; pick the branch; add a Medium with books 10 counted 4, a Large with books 6 counted 8, and a line counted equal to the books; Post | 201 with `countNumber` SC-000001; Medium is now 4 and Large 8 — the drop is never refused; each varianced line writes a `StockMovement` reason ADJUSTMENT referencing the count; the matched line writes none; a count of only matched lines reads "Every line matched the books. Nothing was corrected, and nothing was written to the stock ledger." | P | Not Run |
| STK-002 | A count is immutable, numbered and idempotent (D132) | Post the same form twice with one `idempotencyKey`; post a second count; rename a counted product; sell the counted Medium down to 0 and try to sell one more | One StockTake and one correction; numbers run SC-000001, SC-000002 per tenant; `productNameSnapshot` still shows the old name under Previous counts; there is no edit or delete — a recount is a new count; the sale path still refuses the oversell, so the count never touched the guard | P | Not Run |
| STK-003 | A variance is valued at today's cost or not at all (D131/D132) | Count a variant that has been received (`averageCost` set) short by 2, and a variant nothing has been received against short by 1 | The first line has `unitCost` and `varianceValue` = −2 × cost; the second has both null and is counted in `unvaluedLines`; the document `varianceValue` excludes it rather than valuing it at zero; a variant never reads its parent product's cost | P | Not Run |
| STK-004 | Count refusals (D132) | POST /v1/stock-takes as a Cashier; as Owner with `lines: []`; a negative `countedQuantity`; the same product and variant twice; a branch of another tenant; then on a QuickBooks-inventory tenant | Cashier gets 403 (needs `product:manage`) but may still GET the history; 400 for the empty list and the negative count; 400 "The same product and variant appears twice in this count"; 400 "Branch … does not belong to this tenant"; the QuickBooks tenant gets 400 "Stock counts are not available for this tenant: stock is not held locally…" and nothing is written | N | Not Run |

## RPT — Retail reports (D129/D131)

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| RPT-001 | Margin is costed at today's average and says so (D131) | Sell a variant at 1,000 whose `averageCost` is 600; Reports → Margin (GET /v1/sales/reports/margin); receive more of it at a new cost; reload | Row: revenue 1000.00, cost 600.00, margin 400.00, 40.00%, `costSource` VARIANT_AVERAGE; after the receipt the same sale reads against the new average; the screen states "Cost is the weighted average as it stands today, not the cost on the day of the sale."; rows sort thinnest margin first and a loss shows as a loss | P | Not Run |
| RPT-002 | An unknown cost is unknown, never a 100% margin (D131) | Sell a variant nothing has ever been received against; open Margin | The row shows "—" for cost, margin and percent with `costSource` UNKNOWN and sorts last; totals exclude it and the note "… no recorded cost … not included in the totals above" names the revenue left out; a variant-less line falls to PRODUCT_AVERAGE or LATEST_PURCHASE, a variant never to its parent | N | Not Run |
| RPT-003 | Tax by rate ties to what was charged (D122) | Sales with 18% and zero-rated lines and an order discount; Reports → Tax by rate; include a sale predating per-line rates | Rows "18%" and "0%" whose `tax` sums exactly to the tax the sales recorded, taxable base net of the order discount; the pre-snapshot sale appears as an unattributed row and `hasUnattributed` is said on screen rather than guessed at; total tax agrees with Sales by variant | P | Not Run |
| RPT-004 | Retail reports are money-exact and gated (D129) | Compare Sales by variant totals with the payment ledger for the period; call each /v1/sales/reports/* as a Cashier; send `to` earlier than `from` | Every money figure is a 2dp string that ties to the cent — no float drift; the cashier gets 403 (`report:read`, module REPORTING); the reversed range is refused 400, never swapped | P | Not Run |

## ADM — Administration & Multi-Tenancy

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ADM-001 | Provision fresh tenant | Run provision script with name/slug/users | Tenant + Main Branch + Register 1 + users created; credentials printed | P | Not Run |
| ADM-002 | Provisioned tenant starts empty | Log in as new owner | 0 products/customers/suppliers/sales everywhere | P | Not Run |
| ADM-003 | Provision refuses existing slug/name | Re-run same command | Aborts with clear message; nothing modified | N | Not Run |
| ADM-004 | Provision refuses duplicate email | Use an email that exists in another tenant | Aborts | N | Not Run |
| ADM-005 | Provision validates role and PIN format | Role the business type's template does not offer / 3-digit PIN / duplicate PINs | Each aborts with a specific message naming the offered roles | N | Not Run |
| ADM-006 | Provisioned PINs work for approvals | New tenant owner PIN at discount prompt | Approves within that tenant only | P | Not Run |
| ADM-007 | Tenant data isolation — API | Tenant A token requests tenant B resource ids | 404/empty; never cross-tenant data | N | Not Run |
| ADM-008 | PINs are tenant-scoped | Demo manager PIN in new tenant's approval dialog | 401 Invalid manager PIN | N | Not Run |
| ADM-009 | Document numbering per tenant | Sales in two tenants | Each has its own S-000001 sequence | P | Not Run |
| ADM-010 | Create user via API | Owner POSTs /v1/users | User created in own tenant; can log in | P | Not Run |
| ADM-011 | QuickBooks connections per tenant | Connect tenant A only | Tenant B remains Not connected | P | Not Run |
| ADM-012 | Duplicate email on user create rejected | POST /users with an existing email | 4xx conflict/validation error | N | Not Run |
| ADM-013 | Invalid role on user create rejected | POST /users with role "SUPERADMIN" | 400 | N | Not Run |
| ADM-014 | Audit log records sensitive actions | Approve a discount / change settings; GET /audit-logs | Entries with actor, action, timestamp | P | Not Run |
| ADM-015 | Salesperson is a hardware-template role (D108) | Provision `--business-type RESTAURANT` with a `SALESPERSON` user; then a HARDWARE (or no-profile) tenant with one | Restaurant provisioning aborts naming OWNER, WAITER, RESTAURANT_CASHIER, KITCHEN_STAFF and creates nothing; the hardware user is created linked to the `SALESPERSON` row with enum SALESPERSON | N | Not Run |
| ADM-016 | A fresh database has a RETAIL workspace (D190) | On a database that has never been seeded: `pnpm db:seed`, then sign in at `retail-demo` with `retail.owner@axlopos.test` / `Retail123!` | Signs in. Before D190 the seed created only `demo`, `restaurant-demo` and `platform`, so a teammate given these credentials had no tenant to sign in to — the reported fault | P | Not Run |
| ADM-017 | The seeded retail cashier resolves a role ROW, not the enum (D190) | Sign in as `retail.cashier@axlopos.test` / `Retail123!`; inspect the login response (or Settings → Users) | `roleName` is **Cashier** and permissions come from the role row. RETAIL's templates are Owner and Cashier, whose keys match the enum, so no explicit linking is needed — unlike the restaurant's Waiter and Kitchen | P | Not Run |
| ADM-018 | The retail demo has a real catalogue to work with (D190) | In `retail-demo`, open Products, then add one to the cart in POS | 5 categories; Cotton T-Shirt (12 variants across Size and Colour) and Denim Jeans (4 waist sizes); each variant has its own barcode and branch stock, so the variant picker and stock movements have something to act on | P | Not Run |
| ADM-019 | Re-seeding converges rather than stacking (D190) | Run `pnpm db:seed` twice on the same database and re-count `retail-demo` | Identical both times: 5 categories, 2 products, 16 variants, 16 branch-inventory rows, 2 users, 2 roles and **exactly 1** settings row. `(tenantId, branchId)` has no unique index, so the settings row is guarded by a lookup | N | Not Run |
| ADM-020 | Seeding leaves a hand-made tenant alone (D190) | On a machine that already has a hand-provisioned retail tenant, run `pnpm db:seed` and re-open it | Its products, users and slug are unchanged. The seeded `retail-demo` is added alongside; D190 does not migrate or rename anyone's workspace to claim the slug | N | Not Run |
| ADM-021 | The seed does not echo the retail password (D190) | Read the `pnpm db:seed` console output | It prints the emails and PINs and points at README.md for the password. A credential echoed to a terminal reaches scrollback, CI logs and screenshots | N | Not Run |
| ADM-022 | Both retail trades are seeded (D191) | On a fresh database: `pnpm db:seed`, then sign in at `clothing-demo` and at `grocery-demo` | Both open. Kandy Apparel has 16 products / 44 variants; Colombo Grocery Mart has 6 products sold by weight. D190 seeded one retail tenant with 2 products, so half the product model had no demo at all | P | Not Run |
| ADM-023 | The demo catalogue is the real one, not a stand-in (D191) | In `clothing-demo` open any product the PO has described → compare with their workspace | Same names, SKUs, prices, option values, barcodes and stock. The pack is exported from the workspace, so a teammate opens the shop the PO is talking about rather than one that merely resembles it | P | Not Run |
| ADM-024 | Grocery exercises what clothing cannot (D191) | In `grocery-demo` sell Rice or Coconut Oil | Quantity accepts a DECIMAL amount in `kg` / `L`. Clothing sells by the piece, so a clothing-only demo leaves decimal quantity and unit of measure untested | P | Not Run |
| ADM-025 | A product keeps its zero or one default variant (D191) | Re-seed, then inspect any multi-variant product | At most ONE variant is default, and a product whose source had none still has none. `ProductVariant_productId_default_key` is a partial unique index Prisma cannot express, so a second default fails as a P2002 naming `productId` — which reads like a duplicate product | N | Not Run |
| ADM-026 | The seed stands aside when a slug is taken (D191) | On a machine with a hand-made workspace already using `grocery-demo`, run `pnpm db:seed` | The seed prints `! 'grocery-demo' is already used by ...` and seeds nothing for it. The existing workspace keeps every row — the seed neither renames it nor writes into it. `clothing-demo` still seeds normally | N | Not Run |
| ADM-027 | Refreshing a pack after changing the shop (D191) | Change a price in the app, re-run `db:export-catalogue` for that slug, re-seed a fresh database | The new price appears. The packs are generated, never hand-edited, so the catalogue cannot drift from the workspace it documents | P | Not Run |
| ADM-028 | Two workspaces can each print their own first sale (D192) | In `clothing-demo` complete a sale and print the bill; do the same in `grocery-demo` | Both print. Both receipts read `RCP-S-000001`, because sale numbering restarts per workspace. Before D192 the second one returned a **500** — `Receipt.receiptNumber` was globally unique, so the first workspace to print claimed the string for the whole installation | P | Not Run |
| ADM-029 | A receipt number still cannot repeat inside one workspace (D192) | In one workspace, complete two sales and print both | `RCP-S-000001` and `RCP-S-000002` — never the same number twice. D192 scoped the constraint per tenant; it did not remove it | N | Not Run |
| ADM-030 | Existing hardware and restaurant receipts are unaffected (D192) | Reprint a bill in `demo` and in `restaurant-demo` that was printed before the migration | Identical to what it printed before, same number and same layout. The number FORMAT did not change and no rendering code was touched | N | Not Run |
| ADM-031 | A reprint does not consume a second number (D192) | Print the same sale's bill twice | Same `receiptNumber` both times, one `Receipt` row, print count 2 | N | Not Run |

## UI — Theme, Layout & Responsiveness

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| UI-021 | Pagination is numbered everywhere | Open sales, products, customers, quotations, returns, suppliers, the POS grid, the restaurant orders queue, the ticket history and both customer-page tables | Every footer shows numbered pages with the current one highlighted — no bare Previous/Next anywhere | P | Not Run |
| UI-022 | Page numbers collapse on long lists | A list of 40+ pages | Shows 1 … current-1 current current+1 … last; the first and last stay reachable and the row keeps its width | P | Not Run |
| UI-023 | Rows per page is on every list (D143a) | Open the rows-per-page control on quotations and suppliers, which used to have none, and on the restaurant orders queue with fewer than 20 rows | All three offer it; the queue shows its footer even when everything fits one page, with the paging steps disabled rather than removed — a short list must not make the sizes unreachable | P | Not Run |
| UI-027 | Rows per page offers the same three sizes everywhere | Open the rows-per-page control on sales, products, customers, returns, both customer-page tables, the POS product grid, the ticket history and the restaurant orders queue | Every one offers exactly 20, 50 and 100 — the till's old 20/30/40/50 and the orders queue's 25/50/75/100 are gone; each list starts on 20, the control announces itself as "Rows per page", and picking a size repages from 1 | P | Not Run |
| UI-028 | The brand mark is legible in both themes (D144) | Switch the theme control between Light and Dark on any app page, and open the platform console; then open /login in each theme | The mark is fully visible each time — dark chevrons on the light rail, white on the dark one — at the same size and position, so the wordmark beside it does not shift; the login screen keeps the white mark in both themes because its panel is always dark | P | Not Run |
| UI-029 | No question is asked by the browser any more (D145) | Trigger each guarded action in turn: clear a counter draft with more than one line, clear the retail cart, discard a held basket, close a dine-in table with unsent lines, delete a shared subcategory, reset document settings, and both variant-matrix bulk actions (Generate SKUs, Set reorder for all) | Every one opens the app's own modal — themed, touch-sized, with a verb on the action button — and none opens a browser dialog; the destructive ones are red with Cancel focused, so a stray Enter cancels rather than destroys | P | Not Run |
| UI-030 | A question answers the same way it used to | For each guarded action above: press the action, then repeat and press Cancel, then repeat and press Escape | Confirming does exactly what the native dialog did; Cancel and Escape both leave everything untouched, and the handler behind the question never stalls — the screen is usable immediately either way. On the two prompts, an empty box applied with the action clears the field, while dismissing leaves it alone | P | Not Run |
| UI-031 | Every modal opens in the middle of the screen (PO) | Open any modal at 1440, 1024, 768 and 390 px wide — a confirm, the ticket-order details, a payment dialog | Each is centred vertically and horizontally at every width, never flush to the bottom edge, with a gap to the screen edge and all four corners rounded | P | Not Run |
| UI-032 | Wide panels are centred too, not stuck to the bottom (D145) | Open the dine-in bill, the modifier picker, the payment popup and the variant editor on a desktop window | Each floats in the MIDDLE of the window with the scrim visible above AND below it, rounded on all four corners, with no grab handle. None sits against the bottom edge | P | Not Run |
| UI-033 | The three deliberately edge-anchored surfaces still are (D145) | Open a supplier QuickBooks mapping drawer, an order-detail drawer, the command palette with Ctrl+K, and the retail cart at phone width | The two drawers slide in from the right at full height, the palette opens near the top, and the phone cart rises from the bottom. These are panels and a palette, not questions, and centring them is not wanted | P | Not Run |
| UI-034 | No search bar in the header (D151) | Look at the header beside the theme toggle on any page, at desktop and tablet widths | There is no search box and no ⌘K chip. Pressing Ctrl+K still opens the command palette, Escape closes it, and picking a result still navigates | P | Not Run |
| UI-035 | No counter is named on any screen (D151) | Read the POS header, the service dashboard header and the retail cashier greeting | Each names the branch alone. Nothing reads "Counter 1", no trailing separator is left behind, and the cashier hero shows no register chip. The Register Health card still reports shift and sync state | P | Not Run |
| UI-017 | Tooltips are not clipped by their table | Hover a tooltip in the sales, products, customers or invoices table | The bubble shows in full above the row, not trimmed to the cell or the card | P | Not Run |
| UI-018 | Tooltip follows the page as it scrolls | Hover a tooltip, then scroll the table or the page | It stays with its trigger, or goes away — never stranded mid-screen | P | Not Run |
| UI-019 | Tooltip on a disabled control | Hover the disabled Mark paid on a customer's last invoice | Reason is shown; the button is still not clickable | P | Not Run |
| UI-020 | Tooltip near a viewport edge | Hover a tooltip on the first row and on the rightmost column | Flips below at the top; never runs off the side | P | Not Run |
| UI-001 | Dark mode toggles instantly | Toggle theme | All surfaces/tokens switch (not just scrollbar) | P | Not Run |
| UI-002 | Theme persists across reload | Set dark, reload | No flash of wrong theme (pre-paint script) | P | Not Run |
| UI-003 | System theme mode follows OS | Mode=system, flip OS preference | UI follows live | P | Not Run |
| UI-004 | Sidebar collapse persists | Collapse, reload | Stays collapsed; icons+tooltips shown | P | Not Run |
| UI-005 | Mobile nav drawer | <768px, tap header menu button | Drawer opens; closes on route change and Escape | P | Not Run |
| UI-006 | Header minimal on desktop | ≥768px | No hamburger, no branch/register chips; the account menu shows the person's name and role only (D109) | P | Not Run |
| UI-007 | No horizontal scroll on core pages | 1024/1280/1440 widths: dashboard, POS, quotation builder, lists | Document never scrolls horizontally | P | Not Run |
| UI-008 | Tables scroll within cards | Narrow viewport on suppliers/customers/sales | Table scrolls inside card, not the page | P | Not Run |
| UI-009 | Empty states everywhere | Fresh tenant visits each list | Meaningful empty state + primary action, no spinners stuck | P | Not Run |
| UI-010 | Error toasts/banners recover | Kill API mid-session, then restore + Retry | Clear errors, successful recovery, no stale spinners | N | Not Run |
| UI-011 | Currency formatting consistent | Scan money displays | `Rs. 1,250.00` style everywhere; compact `mil` only on dashboard stats | P | Not Run |
| UI-012 | Keyboard focus visible | Tab through login/POS | Focus rings on interactive elements | P | Not Run |
| UI-013 | Command palette opens with Ctrl/Cmd+K | Press shortcut anywhere in the app | Palette opens; Escape closes | P | Not Run |
| UI-014 | Command palette navigates | Type "sup", pick Suppliers | Route changes; palette closes | P | Not Run |
| UI-015 | Reduced motion respected | Emulate prefers-reduced-motion | Entrance/chart animations neutralized | P | Not Run |

## SEC — Security

| ID | Test Case | Steps | Expected Result | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-001 | All API routes require auth | Call each module root without token | 401 (except login/public quotation/QB callback/health) | N | Not Run |
| SEC-002 | Tenant header cannot spoof access | Valid token A + X-Tenant-Id of B | Server uses token's tenant; B data never returned | N | Not Run |
| SEC-003 | Whitelist validation rejects extra fields | POST with unknown properties | 400 "property should not exist" | N | Not Run |
| SEC-004 | SQL-ish input treated as data | Names like `Robert'); DROP TABLE--` in search/create | Stored/escaped safely; no error 500 | N | Not Run |
| SEC-005 | XSS strings rendered inert | Product/customer name `<img src=x onerror=…>` | Rendered as text everywhere (list, POS, documents) | N | Not Run |
| SEC-006 | Approval tokens single-purpose | Tamper token payload / reuse across tenants | Rejected | N | Not Run |
| SEC-007 | Public quotation link scope | Fetch other ids/tokens on public route | Only the shared quotation readable; guesses 404 | N | Not Run |
| SEC-008 | Secrets never in client bundle | Inspect built web assets | No QBO secrets/DB URLs present | N | Not Run |
| SEC-009 | Upload endpoints validate content type | Product image endpoint with non-image | Rejected; nothing stored | N | Not Run |
| SEC-010 | Rate behavior on repeated failed PINs | Hammer approve endpoint with bad PINs | Consistent 401s, no lockout bypass, no timing leak of valid PINs (best-effort) | N | Not Run |
| SEC-011 | Upload filename traversal blocked | Upload image named `../../evil.png` | Stored under a safe generated key; no path escape | N | Not Run |
| SEC-012 | CORS locked to configured origin | Cross-origin browser request to the API | Blocked by CORS for non-configured origins | N | Not Run |

**Total: 773 test cases** (counted from the tables above; the restaurant modules — EXC, RSV, OTBL, BSPL, KIT — and the retail modules — STK, RPT — are included, and the EXC-T rows now count as coverage since D128 made the transaction real).

### Notes for automation

- IDs are stable — name Playwright specs after them (e.g. `pos.spec.ts` →
  `test('POS-005 typed quantity clamps to stock', …)`).
- Seed-dependent cases (AUTH-007, ADM-*) need the dev seed or the provisioning
  script as fixtures; QB-* cases need a QuickBooks sandbox connection and are
  best tagged `@quickbooks` so they can be excluded from CI without secrets.
- Concurrency cases (PAY-014, PAY-015) are API-level tests, not browser tests.
- Credit-management cases are automated API-level in
  `apps/e2e/tests/credit-management.spec.ts` (28 cases); the remaining ones in those groups
  are browser cases still to be scripted. Credit is settled per CUSTOMER ACCOUNT, so any new
  case must exercise `POST /payments {customerId}` — there is no per-invoice settlement.
