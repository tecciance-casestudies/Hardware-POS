# Product Owner decision log

Authoritative record of decisions governing the Restaurant POS programme.
Nothing elsewhere in this directory overrides an entry here. Append new
decisions; do not rewrite historical ones — supersede them with a new row and
mark the old one.

---

## 2026-08-04 — Phase 0 review

### D1 — `docs/restaurant-backend-plan.md` is superseded
Superseded as the implementation authority by the approved AxloPOS Restaurant POS
requirements. **Not deleted.** It carries a superseded notice and is retained as
historical documentation. Canonical documentation lives in `docs/restaurant-pos/`.

Its *engineering principles* were explicitly retained (additive-only migrations,
no vertical branching in shared modules, server-authoritative state, optimistic
concurrency, one junction point at "closing a session produces a `Sale`",
menu ≠ catalog). Its *data model* and *gating model* were not.

### D2 — Exchanges
The audit confirmed the repository contains an Exchange **A4 document renderer**
but **no** Exchange transaction, Prisma model, migration, API module, route,
permission key, or E2E spec.

Therefore:
- Preserve the existing Exchange document renderer and its current rendering output.
- Keep regression coverage for that renderer.
- Reserve the `EXCHANGES` module key.
- Hide `EXCHANGES` for Restaurant tenants.
- **Do not represent Exchanges as a fully implemented transaction feature.**
- Mark future Exchange transaction test cases `Blocked — feature not implemented`.
- Do not create an Exchange transaction workflow during Phase 1.
- Exchanges remain part of the shared platform for Tile Shop and Hardware tenants;
  Exchange code, structures, permissions, and tests must not be removed.

### D3 — `ModuleKey` enum values are stable database identifiers
The persisted values are fixed as listed in
[`01-platform-architecture.md`](./01-platform-architecture.md). They must not be
renamed without an explicit, approved data-migration strategy.

### D4 — Production database and staging
There is **no approval to run migrations against the live Tile Shop production
database.**

Phase 1 development may use a local disposable PostgreSQL, a seeded test
database, or an isolated integration-test database.

Required before any production migration or deployment:
- a production backup;
- a tested restore process;
- a staging environment or sanitized restorable production snapshot;
- a migration dry run;
- regression tests;
- a rollback or forward-fix plan.

The absence of staging **must not** block local implementation. It **must** block
production migration and deployment. Additive migrations only.

### D5 — Integration-test harness: approved
Requirements: tests must never connect to production; add protection against
production-like database URLs; tests must be repeatable; test data isolated and
cleaned; reuse existing test architecture where practical; keep the local
developer workflow understandable.

### D6 — Printing
Initial physical target: **80 mm network ESC/POS thermal printer.** The
architecture must also support a mock printer adapter, browser/system print
fallback, multiple station printers, and future USB or Bluetooth adapters.

**Printer-specific code must not live inside restaurant order-domain services.**

### D7 — Real-time transport
Use **WebSockets** via a NestJS-compatible architecture, preferably **Socket.IO**
unless repository analysis identifies a strong reason otherwise.

REST/database state is the source of truth. Every real-time screen must
resynchronise after reconnecting.

> Engineering note: Socket.IO across multiple API replicas requires a shared
> adapter (e.g. `@socket.io/redis-adapter`), because rooms and broadcasts are
> per-process. If replicas and WebSockets are both intended, Redis becomes a hard
> dependency at Phase 4. Decide "Redis: yes or no" before Phase 4, not during it.

### D8 — Service charge and tax
Service-charge tax treatment must be **tenant-configurable**. Do not hard-code one
tax interpretation. **Default service charge to disabled until configured.** Final
restaurant-specific tax configuration will be confirmed with an accountant before
production deployment.

### D9 — Uber Eats and PickMe Food
No production partner accounts, sandbox credentials, or final private API
documentation are assumed. Build the generic Online Orders Integration Hub and the
Mock Delivery Adapter first. **Do not claim production Uber Eats or PickMe support**
until official access, documentation, testing, and certification are complete.

### D10 — Multi-branch stock
`Product.quantityOnHand` not being branch-scoped is a **known architectural defect**
for local multi-branch inventory, and is **not an acceptable permanent limitation.**

Introduce a branch-scoped model (`BranchInventory` / `InventoryBalance`).
**Preserve `Product.quantityOnHand`** initially for backward compatibility and
QuickBooks caching. Do not destructively remove or repurpose it.

Scheduled as **Phase 2.5** — after branch scoping (Phase 2), before table sessions
(Phase 5). Rationale in [`phase-01-plan.md`](./phase-01-plan.md).

### D11 — Multiple API replicas
Assume the system may run with more than one API replica. **Do not depend on
process-local cache state for correctness.**

### D12 — README
Approved to correct the materially false project-status line. Factual and concise.

### D13 — Shared `UserRole` enum drift
The shared package's `UserRole` had 3 values against the database's 5. Align
**additively** (add missing keys, rename nothing, no database enum change) and add
a parity test that fails on future drift.

### D14 — `package-lock.json`
The repository is pnpm-based. The stray `package-lock.json` may be removed only
after confirming no CI, deployment, or tooling process depends on it.

> Verified 2026-08-04: no `.github/` directory exists (there is no CI);
> `amplify.yml` uses `npm install -g pnpm@10.33.0` then `pnpm install
> --frozen-lockfile` (a global install ignores the lockfile);
> `apps/api/Dockerfile` copies only `pnpm-lock.yaml`; no reference in
> `docker-compose*.yml`, `.dockerignore`, or `Caddyfile`. Removed in Slice 0 and
> added to `.gitignore` so it cannot return.

### D15 — Production migration gate: approved
The production API container **must not** automatically run Prisma migrations on
every startup.

- Development migrations use an explicit developer command.
- Integration tests may migrate a disposable test database.
- `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_BOOT` defaults to **false** in production.
- Production deployment runs migrations as a **separate one-off step before**
  starting or updating application replicas.
- The explicit migration command is documented in the deployment runbook.
- **Do not execute any migration against the live production database.**

### D16 — Test clarification
Existing behavioural assertions and production regression scenarios must remain
**unchanged**. Test infrastructure, configuration, fixtures, and shared utilities
may be extended as required for the integration-test harness. **Do not weaken or
remove existing coverage.**

### D17 — Tenant isolation
A repeated (100/100) isolation test is useful but **not sufficient alone**. Also
required:

- deterministic service/repository tenant scoping;
- cross-tenant negative integration tests;
- backend permission enforcement;
- branch isolation where applicable;
- **no trust in a request-supplied `tenantId`**;
- tenant identity derived from authenticated server-side context;
- database constraints and indexes where appropriate.

### D18 — Phase 1 implementation authorisation
Slices 0-3 approved for implementation. Slice 4 and later require separate
approval. Explicitly not authorised yet: provider ports; refactoring sales,
returns, or product logic; any restaurant domain feature (tables, menus, KOT,
takeaway, billing, integrations).

---

## 2026-08-04 — Slice 3.5 review

### D19 — Workspace-first authentication (resolves Risk J)
`Tenant.slug` is the **canonical public workspace identifier**.

Browser login will support either a `workspace` field on the login form, or a
tenant-specific URL such as `/login?workspace=<tenant-slug>`. A tenant subdomain
may be supported later. Full rationale and the target contract are in
[`08-authentication-and-workspace-identity.md`](./08-authentication-and-workspace-identity.md).

Target email/password contract:

```json
{ "workspace": "restaurant-name", "email": "user@example.com", "password": "..." }
```

Backward-compatibility rule:
- `workspace` supplied → authenticate **only** inside that tenant.
- `workspace` omitted **and exactly one** active tenant account matches → the
  existing login may continue **temporarily**.
- `workspace` omitted **and several** match → reject with a generic
  `WORKSPACE_REQUIRED` response.

Prohibited:
- **No searchable tenant dropdown.**
- **Do not reveal tenant names from an email address.**
- **Do not return the matching tenant names.**
- **Do not indicate how many tenants matched.**
- **Do not expose whether the email exists in another tenant.**
- No tenant enumeration through login error responses.

PIN authentication remains explicitly scoped through the appropriate tenant,
branch, and register context.

The browser workspace-login **user interface** belongs to the frontend
modularisation phase (Slice 8). Slice 4 must not become an authentication UI
redesign.

### D20 — Authentication throttling is a release gate (Risk K)
Throttling stays in **Slice 7** and is now a **mandatory gate** before public
staging, internet-accessible demonstrations, pilot deployment, and production
deployment.

Slice 7 must protect at least `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/pin-login`, and
refresh-token abuse where appropriate. The design must consider: source IP;
tenant/workspace; normalised email or login identifier; branch/register context
for PIN login; a generic HTTP 429; `Retry-After`; account-enumeration safety;
proxy-aware client IP handling; multiple API replicas; and a
distributed-compatible limiter or infrastructure-level rate limiting with an
application backstop.

**Do not implement throttling during Slice 4.** Do not make unrelated
authentication changes during Slice 4.

### D21 — Slice 4 authorisation
Slice 4 (platform data model and tenant module foundation) approved. Slice 5 and
later still require separate approval.

Authorised: `TenantBusinessProfile`, `TenantModule`, the business-profile enums,
effective legacy defaults, the platform profile service and API, the module-access
guard, permissions, one additive migration, and tests.

Not authorised: provider ports, inventory providers, accounting providers,
restaurant domain models, restaurant UI, and any refactor of sales, returns, or
product logic.

Database constraints for this slice:
- The migration may create `TenantBusinessProfile` and `TenantModule` only.
- No `DROP`, no column rename, no data deletion, no `UPDATE` of existing tenant
  data, **no backfill of existing tenants**.
- `Product.quantityOnHand` is not repurposed.
- No restaurant operational tables.
- **A tenant with no `TenantBusinessProfile` row is a first-class supported
  state** that resolves to the legacy Tile Shop behaviour. Existing tenants must
  not be made to run a setup wizard or reconnect QuickBooks.

---

## 2026-08-04 — Slice 4 review

### D22 — Route and module guard strategy (resolves Risk Q)
The single-controller module guard delivered in Slice 4 is **accepted as
architectural proof**. **Do not add `@RequireModule` blindly to every existing
controller.**

Rules, recorded in full in
[`01-platform-architecture.md`](./01-platform-architecture.md#route-classification-decision-d22):

1. Shared AxloPOS core routes are controlled by authentication, tenant isolation,
   and permissions — **not** by optional business-module flags.
2. Business-specific workflow routes must require the relevant `ModuleKey`.
3. A controller containing both shared and business-specific operations must be
   mapped at route level, or split, **before** any controller-level guard.
4. Every future Restaurant-specific controller must fail closed and declare its
   required module explicitly.
5. **No new Restaurant route may exist without backend module enforcement.**
6. A complete route-to-module matrix must be produced and **approved before the
   first real Restaurant tenant is onboarded**.
7. **Do not perform the comprehensive guard rollout during Slice 5.**

The matrix must inspect the actual repository and classify every controller and
route as one of `SHARED_CORE` or a specific `ModuleKey`. **Route classifications
must not be guessed without reading the route's business responsibility.**

### D23 — Platform profile read access
Effective-profile read access is **kept for CASHIER and every other authenticated
role**. The front-end needs it for module-aware navigation and capability
decisions. `GET /v1/platform/profile` may be used by any authenticated user.

The user-safe response may contain `businessType`, `inventoryMode`,
`accountingProvider`, `enabledModules`, the profile source, `version`, and safe
presentation metadata where required.

It must **not** expose QuickBooks access or refresh tokens, delivery-platform
credentials, API secrets, encrypted credential values, internal infrastructure
configuration, or any other tenant's data.

`PATCH /v1/platform/profile` remains restricted to **OWNER** and **ADMIN**.
CASHIER, MANAGER, and ACCOUNTANT must not update the profile. Backend permission
enforcement is preserved.

### D24 — Slice 5 authorisation
Slice 5 (provider ports, implementations, and factories) approved. Slice 6 requires
separate approval.

Slice 5 is **structural and inert**: it must not change call sites in sales,
returns, products, quotations, payments, the QuickBooks workers, or existing sync
orchestration. The existing Tile Shop continues to use the exact current code paths.

Required:
- Contracts derived from **characterised existing behaviour**, not speculation.
- No QuickBooks SDK types and no REST DTOs in provider interfaces — AxloPOS-owned
  input and result types only.
- Every mutating provider method accepts a caller-supplied
  `Prisma.TransactionClient`; providers never open a nested transaction; the caller
  keeps transaction boundaries; a failed provider mutation participates in the
  caller's rollback.
- `LocalInventoryProvider` must **not** claim multi-branch correctness using the
  global `Product.quantityOnHand`; it fails closed with a typed error for
  multi-branch tenants. `Product.quantityOnHand` stays preserved.
- `NoInventoryProvider` / `NoAccountingProvider` write no `SyncJob` or `SyncLog`,
  create no QuickBooks document ids, never call QuickBooks, and never pretend an
  external sync occurred.
- `EXTERNAL` inventory and `FUTURE_EXTERNAL` accounting **fail closed** with typed
  unsupported-provider errors. **No silent fallback** to QuickBooks, Local, or None.
- No Prisma migration. No `BranchInventory`. No restaurant domain models or UI.

---

## 2026-08-04 — Slice 5 review

### D25 — No-accounting result model
**Do not represent `NoAccountingProvider` with an ambiguous combination** such as
`markSynced: true` together with `quickbooksDocumentType: null`.

A tenant on `AccountingProviderKind.NONE` has completed the transaction **locally
and completely** but has synchronised nothing to an external system. Use a
provider-neutral discriminated union:

```ts
type AccountingSubmissionResult =
  | { disposition: 'QUEUED';       provider: 'QUICKBOOKS'; externalDocumentType: 'SALES_RECEIPT' | 'INVOICE' }
  | { disposition: 'NOT_REQUIRED'; provider: 'NONE';       externalDocumentType: null };
```

For `NONE`: no QuickBooks API call, no `SyncJob`, no `SyncLog`, no QuickBooks
document id, no claim that an external synchronisation occurred, a clear
`NOT_REQUIRED` result, and no secret or provider-specific detail exposed.

**No new Prisma enum and no migration.** The result stays an application-level union.

### D26 — Customer documents must not depend on `quickbooksDocumentType`
`quickbooksDocumentType` is **external-integration metadata only.** It must not be
the authoritative source for receipt-versus-invoice selection, receipt title, A4
template selection, print eligibility, or any customer-facing document label.

Document selection uses local AxloPOS financial semantics: a fully paid local sale
is a receipt, a partial or credit sale is an invoice/credit document, a return is a
return document. The Exchange renderer is unchanged.

A null external document type must never cause a runtime exception, a blank document
title, the wrong template, "Synced to QuickBooks" wording, a missing print action, or
an invalid API response.

`postPayment()` must **not** be added to `AccountingProvider` during Slice 5 or 5.5.
`PaymentsService.create` is unimplemented and there is no characterised standalone
payment workflow. Restaurant split and mixed payments will initially be local
`Payment` records inside an order/sale completion transaction. Add a separate
accounting payment operation only when an approved, implemented workflow exists —
paying an existing credit invoice later, posting a payment separately from sale
creation, or applying a settlement against a previously created invoice. **Do not
design speculative provider operations.** Recorded in
[`02-provider-abstractions.md`](./02-provider-abstractions.md).

---

## 2026-08-05 — Slice 6B review

### D27 — Local customer return-document kind (resolves Risk AG)

`CustomerReturnDocumentKind` is decided from **local financial facts**, never from
`Return.quickbooksDocumentType`. For a return whose original sale was filed under
`AccountingProviderKind.NONE`:

* a positive monetary refund actually issued → **`REFUND_RECEIPT`**;
* no money refunded, but store credit issued or an unpaid balance reduced →
  **`CREDIT_NOTE`**.

**Mixed results.** A return that contains both a monetary refund *and* a credit or
balance adjustment uses **`REFUND_RECEIPT`** as the primary document kind, and must
show three separate values — monetary refund, store credit issued, and
outstanding-balance reduction. **These must never be combined into a single
"refund" amount**, which would overstate the cash returned.

Not yet reachable: `Return.refundMethod` is a single method and `createCompleted`
writes exactly one `RefundPayment`, so no mixed return can currently exist. This
decision governs whichever slice introduces multi-method refunds; a
`CustomerReturnDocumentKind` of `REFUND_RECEIPT` must not be taken as a licence to
print one combined figure.

**QuickBooks tenants are unchanged.** Wherever an external document type exists it
stays authoritative for the printed label, so a QuickBooks tenant's documents are
byte-identical. The local kind and the external `QuickBooksReturnDocumentType`
remain two separate decisions with two separate resolvers, deliberately: the
implemented rules diverge for a **partially-paid sale refunded in money**, where
local semantics say refund receipt (cash left the drawer, and the return does not
reduce the sale balance) and QuickBooks says credit memo. That divergence is pinned
by test rather than reconciled.

### D28 — Product QuickBooks treatment routes on `InventoryMode` (resolves Risk AF)

Product QuickBooks treatment must be removed for tenants that do not use QuickBooks
inventory, and the routing key is **`InventoryMode`, not `AccountingProviderKind`**:

| Mode | Product behaviour |
|---|---|
| `QUICKBOOKS` | Preserve today's pull/push, QuickBooks item ids, and sync statuses. Existing Tile Shop behaviour is unchanged. |
| `LOCAL` | Locally managed. Create/update/deactivate must **not** enqueue a QuickBooks product sync. Stock operations use `LocalInventoryProvider`. |
| `DISABLED` | A catalogue may exist. No availability enforcement, no stock mutation, no QuickBooks product synchronisation. |
| `EXTERNAL` | Fail closed until an approved implementation exists. |

Deferred to **Slice 6C-B — Product Catalogue and Synchronization Provider
Adoption**, and explicitly out of scope for Slice 6C-A.

Constraints on that slice: the provider abstraction owns the routing decision.
`ProductsService` must not acquire `if (accountingProvider === NONE)` or
`if (inventoryMode !== QUICKBOOKS)` conditionals, and `BusinessProfileService` must
not be injected into it merely to trade one hard-coded QuickBooks branch for
several profile branches. Before implementing, decide between extending
`InventoryProvider` with provider-neutral product lifecycle operations and
introducing a separate `CatalogProvider`.

Unsupported combinations must also be audited rather than silently accepted —
notably **`LOCAL` inventory + `QUICKBOOKS` accounting** and **`DISABLED` inventory +
`QUICKBOOKS` accounting**, since QuickBooks accounting documents may require valid
QuickBooks item mappings that neither mode maintains.

### D29 — Inventory-mode changes are unsupported once stock has moved

Inventory authority and accounting provenance are **separate concepts**. A return
resolves accounting from the original sale's provenance (D-Slice 6B) but resolves
inventory from the tenant's **current** `InventoryMode` — there is no per-sale
inventory provenance, and inferring one from QuickBooks accounting metadata would
conflate the two.

That is only safe if the mode cannot change underneath existing transactions. No
safe transition mechanism exists (no stock migration, no per-sale inventory
authority record), so `BusinessProfileService.updateProfile` **refuses** to change
`inventoryMode` once inventory-affecting transactions exist for the tenant.

Allowed regardless: a write that does not change the effective mode — which
includes legacy-default → explicit `QUICKBOOKS`, since the legacy default *is*
`QUICKBOOKS`. Allowed for a tenant with no completed sales and no returns: any mode.

No migration. The guard reads existing tables.

---

## 2026-08-05 — Slice 6C-B review

### D30 — Architectural-test integrity standard (resolves Risk AH)

The standard introduced during Slice 6C-A.5 is now a **permanent AxloPOS
engineering rule**, and applies to every future slice.

It exists because Slice 6C-A shipped structural tripwires that were green while
asserting something false. That is a worse failure than a missing test: a missing
test is visibly missing, whereas a vacuous one is indistinguishable from a passing
one and actively discourages anyone from looking again.

**A structural, scope-control or source-inspection test must not pass merely
because:**

- Two counts happen to be equal.
- A searched string is absent from both the adopted and the unadopted path.
- An analyser silently ignored a file.
- A fixture does not represent the real production structure.
- A regular expression fails to match either the valid or the invalid state.
- A renamed symbol caused the test to inspect nothing.
- The test asserts only that a future feature is absent, without proving the
  expected current path exists.

**Required standard:**

1. Assert the expected current behaviour **positively**.
2. Assert the prohibited or future behaviour **negatively**.
3. Prefer exact file or importer **sets** over counts.
4. Use **runtime provider spies** where possible, in preference to source text.
5. **Mutation-prove** high-risk architectural tripwires.
6. Ensure analysers have tests for: valid source, invalid source, empty source,
   a renamed symbol, nested or multiline syntax, and every applicable import form.
7. **Fail** if the analyser inspects zero relevant files unexpectedly.
8. Report which architectural tests were mutation-proven.

**Scope of the mutation requirement.** Focused, inline mutation proofs at
high-risk boundaries only. No repository-wide mutation-testing framework is
introduced, and none should be added as a side effect of this rule.

Recorded operationally in
[`05-testing-strategy.md`](./05-testing-strategy.md#architectural-test-standard-in-brief-d30)
and in the repository engineering guide (`CLAUDE.md`).

### D31 — Product presentation routes on the effective profile, resolved once

The product screens must reflect the tenant's `InventoryMode`, and the **only**
admissible source for that mode is `GET /v1/platform/profile`. It must never be
inferred from `quickbooksItemId`, `syncStatus`, the product name, the business type,
or the presence of a QuickBooks connection — none of those can distinguish "this
tenant does not use QuickBooks" from "this tenant uses QuickBooks and this product
has not reached it yet".

The decision is taken **once**, in a pure resolver
(`apps/web/src/lib/products/product-presentation.ts`), which returns view flags.
Components read flags; no product component compares an inventory mode. This is the
frontend counterpart of the D28 constraint on `ProductsService`, and for the same
reason: replacing one hard-coded QuickBooks branch with several profile branches
spread across a table, a detail page and three wizard steps is not an improvement.

| Mode | Product interface |
|---|---|
| `QUICKBOOKS` | Unchanged. Sync status, explicit sync, refresh, accounts panel and existing wording all preserved. Legacy tenants resolve here. |
| `LOCAL` | Provider-neutral "Locally managed". Stock is real and editable. No sync surface of any kind. A null `quickbooksItemId` is never styled as a fault. |
| `DISABLED` | "Catalogue item" / "Stock tracking disabled". Full CRUD, no stock figures, no sync surface. |
| `EXTERNAL` | Fails safe: a generic configuration warning, and no fallback to QuickBooks or Local. |
| Unresolved | While loading **and** after a failed profile request: neutral, no external action, no claim about stock. The client never defaults to the legacy configuration. |

`Product.syncStatus` is unchanged and remains legacy external-integration state. No
Prisma migration.

**Hiding is usability, not security.** Backend provider resolution and permission
enforcement remain the authority; a hidden control is still refused server-side.

---

## 2026-08-05 — Slice 7 review

### D32 — Authentication throttling is a storage abstraction, not a claim

Login, PIN login and refresh are rate-limited on **two dimensions at once** — a
source dimension and an identity dimension — because either alone is trivially
defeated: identity-only loses to a botnet against one account, source-only loses to
a spray across many accounts from one address. The strictest verdict wins.

The identity key is **tenant-scoped**. Keying on the email alone would let a failed
campaign against `owner@acme.test` in tenant A lock out the unrelated
`owner@acme.test` in tenant B — one tenant denying service to another through a
shared address. PIN keys never contain the submitted PIN, which would otherwise hand
an attacker a fresh allowance per guess.

A successful authentication **clears** the keys it spent, so recovery is not punished.

Responses are a generic 429 with `Retry-After` and nothing else — no indication of
which counter tripped, whether the account exists, or which tenant it is in.

**Client IP is resolved by counting from the RIGHT of `X-Forwarded-For`**, `N` hops
in, where `N` is `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOP_COUNT` (default **0** = ignore the header). The
left-most entry is attacker-controlled; trusting it is the most common rate-limiter
bypass there is. The default fails safe: a deployment that forgets to configure it
gets a limiter that is too aggressive behind a balancer, not one that is silently
bypassable.

**The limitation, stated plainly.** `MemoryRateLimitStore` is process-local
(`isDistributed === false`). It protects a single replica. With several replicas each
holds its own counters and the effective allowance multiplies. This is **not** a
multi-replica correctness model, and Phase 1 does not claim it is. The boot log says
so on every start. Production with more than one replica needs a distributed
`RateLimitStore` (Redis `INCR`/`EXPIRE` maps onto the interface directly) or an edge
rate limiter. Blocked on open decision O2.

### D33 — Workspace-first authentication, and the disclosure it makes

`POST /auth/login` accepts an optional `workspace` slug. Resolution order: `workspace`
→ `x-tenant-id` header → unique match on the email alone. All three are
client-supplied and only ever **narrow** the lookup; the password is always verified
against the resolved user's own hash, so a wrong value can only make a login fail.

An email held by several active workspaces returns `AUTH_WORKSPACE_REQUIRED` (409)
instead of the generic 401 that Slice 3.5 introduced. **This is a deliberate change
to an existing behavioural assertion**, and the reason is that the 3.5 behaviour left
a legitimate user with no way forward — correct passwords simply stopped working with
nothing to act on.

The residual disclosure is recorded rather than hidden: the response reveals that the
address exists in **more than one** workspace. It reveals no names, no slugs, no
count, and nothing about any particular workspace. Single-workspace addresses — the
overwhelming majority — disclose nothing at all and return the same generic 401 as an
unknown address. The ambiguous branch also short-circuits before any bcrypt round,
which is asserted explicitly; it adds nothing beyond what the response already says.

An unknown *or deactivated* workspace is indistinguishable from a wrong password.

### D34 — One authority for roles and permissions; settings are eventually consistent

`@hardware-pos/shared` is the single definition of `UserRole`, `Permission` and
`ROLE_PERMISSIONS`. `apps/api` and `apps/web` re-export it. Both copies had already
drifted before this slice — the shared `UserRole` was missing `OWNER` and
`ACCOUNTANT`, and the web permission list never received the two `PLATFORM_PROFILE_*`
entries added in Slice 4 — and nothing failed, because nothing compared them.
Parity is now asserted against the Prisma enum. Restaurant permissions extend this
map; there will be no second permission authority.

**Settings consistency window.** The settings cache was hydrated at boot and
refreshed only by writes on that process, which with several replicas was not stale
but *permanently wrong*. Each entry now records when it was read and revalidates in
the background past `SETTINGS_CACHE_TTL_MS` (30s). The guarantee:

> A settings write is observable on every replica within
> `SETTINGS_CACHE_TTL_MS` + one database round trip, and immediately on the replica
> that performed the write.

Deliberately eventual: settings are display and policy defaults. Anything that must
be immediately correct across replicas — module access, provider routing — does not
use this cache and reads the database per request, because a stale module revocation
would fail **open** (D11).

### D35 — Route-module matrix, and where guards are deferred

Every one of the 139 routes is classified, enforced by a spec that reads Nest's own
metadata. See [`route-module-matrix.md`](./route-module-matrix.md). 79 routes carry
`@RequireModule`; 60 do not, each for a stated reason.

Notably **`/products` is `SHARED_CORE`, not `INVENTORY`** — products are the
catalogue, which every business profile needs, while `INVENTORY` means stock tracking,
already governed by `InventoryMode` (D28, D31). Gating catalogue CRUD on `INVENTORY`
would stop a Restaurant tenant managing its own products.

`RETAIL_POS` on sales/payments/receipts is classified but **not yet enforced**:
gating it would deny a Restaurant tenant read access to its own sales history, and
splitting read from write needs the Phase 2 ordering model settled.

`@Public()` routes cannot carry a module guard — `ModuleAccessGuard` denies anything
requiring a module without an authenticated tenant — so the QuickBooks OAuth callback
and the public quotation link enforce their own tokens instead.

Tile Shop is unaffected throughout: every gated module is in the legacy default set.

---

## Phase 1.5 — platform and branch security hardening

Approved at the Phase 1 checkpoint. The phase was renamed from "Restaurant Phase 2"
because it contains no restaurant domain entity and no restaurant operational
workflow; see [`phase-1_5-plan.md`](./phase-1_5-plan.md).

### D36 — Roles are per-tenant rows, never shared

`Role.tenantId` is `NOT NULL`. Each tenant owns its five built-in roles plus any it
creates, and no row is shared between tenants.

The alternative — global built-in rows with `tenantId NULL` and per-tenant
overrides — stores fewer rows and creates a cross-tenant **write** surface: one
`OWNER` row serving every tenant means any update path that forgets its
`tenantId` predicate edits every tenant at once. That is the same class of defect
as D-slice-3.5's login lookup, which returned an arbitrary tenant's user because
the query had no tenant predicate. Paying five rows per tenant at provisioning is
the cheaper side of that trade.

Consequence: `provision-tenant.ts` and `seed.ts` must seed the built-in roles, and
a tenant created without them has no role rows — which must fail closed, not fall
through to "no permissions".

### D37 — Permissions are a code catalogue; the database stores only assignments

The list of permissions that exist stays in `packages/shared` as a TypeScript
union. The database stores which role holds which permission, and nothing else.

A `Permission` table that tenants can insert into invites permissions the codebase
has never heard of. No decorator references them, no guard enforces them, and they
grant exactly nothing — while looking, in an admin screen, like access control. The
compiler is the right authority for *what can exist*; the database is the right
authority for *who has it*.

Permission string values are already treated as an immutable storage contract
(`authorization.ts`), which this makes load-bearing rather than aspirational.

### D38 — The access token carries `activeBranchId`, and the server re-validates it every request

The claim is a hint, never proof. `BranchScopeGuard` re-checks on every
branch-scoped request that the branch belongs to the authenticated tenant, is
active, and is still one the user may use — and that any register named belongs to
that branch.

This is what makes the Product Owner's requirement satisfiable: *"branch access
changes must not remain valid indefinitely because an old JWT contains a branch
ID."* Trusting the claim would make revocation wait for token expiry. Resolving the
branch per request with no claim at all would also be correct, but it loses the
ability to switch branches without a stored preference, and it still costs the same
lookup the validation costs.

Fails closed: a claim naming a branch the user may no longer use is a 403, not a
fallback to the user's default branch — silently serving a *different* branch's data
than the client believes it is showing is worse than refusing.

### D39 — No Redis yet; the abstraction ships, the dependency does not

`RateLimitStore` keeps its process-local implementation as the only one. The
distributed contract is specified and the deployment requirement documented, and
the API refuses to start if it is configured for several replicas without a
distributed store — rather than starting and quietly protecting one process.

The same abstraction is reused for cross-replica settings invalidation, so
answering O2 later switches both at once. Until then **multi-replica operation is
unsupported and is documented as such**, which is honest where "we have rate
limiting" would not be.

O2 stays open. It becomes forced at Phase 4, where the Socket.IO adapter needs a
shared backplane and no abstraction can paper over it.

### D40 — The dormant `Role` / `Permission` tables are adopted, not replaced

`Role`, `Permission` and `User.roleId` already exist in the schema. They hold
**zero rows in every environment**, and no application code reads or writes them —
grep finds no `prisma.role`, no `prisma.permission`, and no non-spec use of
`roleId`. They are scaffolding from an earlier design that was never wired up.

Phase 1.5 adopts these tables rather than adding a parallel set. Two consequences:

- The migration is far smaller than planned, and carries **no data migration** —
  there is no data.
- `Role` is keyed `@@unique([tenantId, name])`, i.e. on a *display name*. A built-in
  role identified by the string an admin can rename is a defect waiting to happen,
  so an additive `Role.key` column is required, unique per tenant, holding the
  stable `OWNER` / `ADMIN` / … identifiers. `name` becomes presentation only.

Recording this because a reader of the Phase 1 plan would reasonably assume these
tables were part of the working system. They are not, and a structural test that
asserted their existence would have passed while proving nothing.

## 2026-08-11 — Restaurant Menu Wizard

### D41 — Additive presentation fields on `MenuItem` + role marker on `ModifierGroup`
Approved to unblock the Add Menu Item wizard whose mock includes fields the
schema does not persist today.

**Additive columns** (migration `20260811000000_add_menu_item_presentation_fields`):

- `MenuItem.imageUrl TEXT NULL` — item photo URL; media pipeline reuses the
  one `Product.imageUrl` already uses. NULL renders the menu card placeholder.
- `MenuItem.itemType MenuItemType NULL` (enum `FOOD | BEVERAGE | DESSERT`) —
  wizard segmented control. NULL on legacy rows (Menu filter treats as unset).
- `MenuItem.dietaryTags TEXT[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` — presentation chips
  (Veg / Non-Veg / Egg / Spicy / Gluten-Free). Tenants may add more strings;
  server does not enforce vocabulary.
- `MenuItem.prepMinutes INTEGER NULL` — menu-level preparation estimate.
  Distinct from `KitchenTicket.prepMinutes` which is a per-ticket actual.
  NULL on legacy rows and Prepared Dishes without an estimate.
- `ModifierGroup.role TEXT NULL` — wizard marker. `'SIZE'` for variation groups
  (Small / Medium / Large); NULL for ordinary groups. Server enforces nothing
  on this string — it is a frontend semantics marker so an edit round-trip does
  not lose the wizard's intent.

**Non-goals of D41:**

- No new media pipeline. `imageUrl` accepts a URL string; upload plumbing is
  the pre-existing product-image mechanism.
- No dietary-tag enum. Tenants can add strings ad-hoc.
- No enforcement of `ModifierGroup.role` values on the server.

**Compatibility:** every new column is nullable or has a safe default read.
Pre-migration rows remain valid; existing callers that omit the new fields
receive the previous behaviour.

**Variations pricing (approved with D41):** Small/Medium/Large are persisted
as `ModifierOption.priceDelta` on a `ModifierGroup(selection=SINGLE, min=1,
max=1, role='SIZE')`. The wizard UI collects and displays the *adjustment*
(Small +0, Medium +300, Large +600). One arithmetic authority, no double
storage. POS renders it exactly like any SINGLE modifier group.

### D42 — Menu item Delete uses archive semantics
The card `•••` menu presents "Delete" to the operator but the implementation
sets `isActive = false` via `PATCH /menu-items/:id`. Historical orders,
kitchen tickets, bills and reports retain the item unchanged — a hard
delete would break the historical join. Wording on the confirmation dialog
makes this explicit to the operator.

Never-used items may still be true-deleted in a follow-up if the backend
grows a safe path for it; the wizard does not need it.

**Superseded 2026-08-12 by D43.**

### D43 — Menu admin: hard delete + Set Active/Inactive as distinct actions

Product Owner requires permanent delete for Menus, Sections and Menu Items.
The domain supports it safely: `RestaurantOrderItem` / `KitchenTicketItem`
carry `menuItemName / menuItemCode / unitPrice / modifierTotal` snapshots at
submit time, and `menuItemId` on those rows is a **loose string reference**
with no Prisma relation. Deleting a `MenuItem` does not cascade into finance
or ticket history.

Split the two operations on the card `•••` menu:

- **Set Active / Set Inactive** — `PATCH /menu-items/:id { isActive }`. The
  archive verb of the old D42. Historical rows untouched. POS hides the item
  while it is Inactive (server-enforced via the existing `isActive` filter);
  the server also refuses a POS attempt to add an Inactive item to an order.
- **Delete permanently** — `DELETE /menu-items/:id`. Refuses with a
  structured 409 (`ITEM_ON_OPEN_ORDER`) if any `RestaurantOrderItem` for the
  item is on an order in `DRAFT / SUBMITTED / PARTIAL`. Once every open
  reference closes (`COMPLETED / CANCELLED`), delete succeeds.
- **Sections** — `DELETE /menu-sections/:id`. Refuses with `SECTION_HAS_ITEMS`
  if any `MenuItem` is still attached (active or inactive). Operator must
  move or delete items first.
- **Menus** — `DELETE /menus/:id`. Refuses with `MENU_HAS_SECTIONS` if the
  menu still contains any section.

**Permissions** — reused `PRODUCT_MANAGE` per Section 2 of the brief ("Reuse
equivalent existing permissions instead of creating duplicates"). Held by
OWNER + ADMIN today; MANAGER + CASHIER do not have it. A dedicated
`MENU_DELETE` remains available as a future split without changing the API
contract.

**Image storage** — image upload for the wizard uses the existing
`StorageService` (local disk in dev, S3 in prod; validated MIME, sharp
downscale, WebP re-encode, UUID key). Two endpoints:

- `POST /restaurant/menu-items/image` — standalone, returns `{ imageUrl }`
  the wizard sends on the subsequent `create`. Orphan sweep is a follow-up.
- `POST /restaurant/menu-sections/:sectionId/items/:itemId/image` — attach
  to an existing item (Edit flow), mirrors the Products pattern; old asset
  is retired only after the DB update commits.

---

## 2026-08-12 — Product variants + Purchase Receipts + Weighted-Average

### D44 — Products own variants; Receive Stock owns cost history; costing is weighted-average

Approved for AxloPOS Product Management to gain multi-dimensional variants,
a proper Receive Stock (Purchase Receipt) workflow, and immutable historical
purchase cost. Legacy (variant-less) Products and Tile Shop / QuickBooks
behaviour remain unchanged.

**Domain model.**

- A `Product` is the commercial master. It may have **0..N** variation
  dimensions (`ProductVariationDimension`) — not limited to two. Each
  dimension owns 0..N `ProductVariationOption` rows (e.g. Size → 200ml /
  300ml / 500ml). Every *sellable combination* the operator enables becomes
  one `ProductVariant` with independent SKU, barcode, selling price,
  weighted-average cost, per-branch inventory, and reorder point.
- `ProductVariantOptionValue` fixes one option per dimension for each
  variant. A product with 2 dimensions × 6 enabled variants stores 12 rows
  here — one row per (variant, dimension).
- `Product.hasVariants` is the single boolean the API and UI branch on:
  - `false` → legacy Product; `unitPrice`, `sku`, `costPrice`,
    `quantityOnHand`, `averageCost` on the Product row are authoritative.
    Existing Tile Shop tenants stay exactly here.
  - `true` → the `ProductVariant` rows are authoritative for price, cost,
    SKU, barcode, and per-branch inventory. The parent-level fields remain
    as legacy fallbacks and are never read.
- A `SaleItem`, `ReturnItem`, `MenuItem`, `BranchInventory`, `StockMovement`
  or `InventoryReceiptLine` may carry `productVariantId`; NULL keeps the
  legacy per-product semantics.

**Product variants ≠ Restaurant menu variations.** Menu Small/Medium/Large
remains a `ModifierGroup(role='SIZE', selection=SINGLE)` per D41. Menu
variations are customer-facing customisation of one dish; product variants
are physically distinct stockable items. The wizards share visual language
per the Restaurant Menu Wizard pattern; the domain models stay separate.

**Purchase Receipts / cost history.**

- Vendor stock enters the system exclusively through **Receive Stock**.
  Editing `Product.quantityOnHand` or `ProductVariant`-side quantity from
  the Product form is no longer the supported path for adding stock; the
  wizard's Step 3 "Opening Quantity" applies once, on creation, then Receive
  Stock takes over.
- `InventoryReceipt` (header) + `InventoryReceiptLine` (per-variant line)
  are immutable once written. A correction goes through a new movement,
  never by mutating history. `InventoryReceipt.idempotencyKey` guards
  against a double-submitted form.
- Every receipt writes an append-only `StockMovement` row with
  `reason=RECEIPT`, `refType='INVENTORY_RECEIPT_LINE'`, `refId=line.id`,
  and `unitCost` captured on the movement. Sales / returns / adjustments
  continue to write their existing reasons.

**Weighted-Average costing (MVP).**

- Costing policy is fixed to **`WEIGHTED_AVERAGE`** for the first commercial
  release; no per-tenant switch, no enum column. Every receipt into a
  `(branch, variant?)` cell recomputes:

  `newAvg = ((existingQty × existingAvg) + (receivedQty × unitCost)) / (existingQty + receivedQty)`

  When `existingAvg` is NULL the received `unitCost` is adopted directly.
- The rollup is stored on `BranchInventory.averageCost` (per branch, per
  variant/product); `ProductVariant.averageCost` and `Product.averageCost`
  are updated as the quantity-weighted mean across the variant's / product's
  branches on receive for fast list rendering. All rollups are recomputable
  from the ledger — no rollup is a source of truth.

**FIFO readiness.** No FIFO logic ships. But every `InventoryReceiptLine`
is immutable and every RECEIPT `StockMovement` snapshots `unitCost`, so a
future policy can walk history lot-by-lot without a schema change.

**Selling price is not touched by a receipt.** A cost increase surfaces to
the operator (margin banner on the Variants / Inventory tab); the operator
alone decides whether to change customer price. No auto-repricing.

**Branch-scoped stock is authoritative.** `BranchInventory` becomes the read
authority for variants. `Product.quantityOnHand` is retained per D10 as the
legacy rollup + QuickBooks cache — never dropped, never repurposed. Sales /
returns / restaurant orders still route through the existing
`InventoryProvider` port; the port grows `receiveStock(tx, ctx, lines)`
implemented by `LocalInventoryProvider` (writes `BranchInventory` +
`StockMovement`), refused by `QuickBooksInventoryProvider` (QB is the stock
authority — a future slice adds `PurchaseOrder` push), and refused by
`NoInventoryProvider` (stock tracking is off).

**Module boundary (D28 / D31 respected).** Receive Stock lives in a new
`InventoryReceiptsModule` that holds `InventoryProviderFactory`.
`ProductsService` still resolves ONLY `CatalogSyncProviderFactory` — the
per-slice tripwire at `provider-contract.spec.ts:251-273` stays green.
Variant CRUD lives inside the products module as a `ProductVariantsService`
that holds no provider port at all (it never moves stock — receiving does).

**Frontend routing (D31 respected).** The 4-step Add Product wizard reads
the tenant's inventory mode from `GET /v1/platform/profile` via the pure
resolver at `apps/web/src/lib/products/product-presentation.ts`. Wizard
Step 3 hides Opening Stock / Reorder in `DISBLED` mode; Receive Stock is
suppressed in `QUICKBOOKS` mode with the wording "Stock is managed in
QuickBooks." No component compares an `InventoryMode` value.

**Backward compatibility.**

- Every existing Product remains valid with `hasVariants=false` and no
  ProductVariant rows. The old create endpoint, product form, POS lookup,
  QuickBooks push, retail sale, and return flow all continue unchanged.
- `MenuItem.productId` still means what it did; the additive
  `productVariantId` narrows it to a specific variant when set.
- Every existing sale / return keeps its rows and its printable document.
  `SaleItem.productVariantId` is NULL on all historical rows.

**Migration.** `20260812000000_add_product_variants_and_purchase_receipts`.

- Creates the six new tables listed above.
- Adds nullable / defaulted columns to `Product`, `SaleItem`, `ReturnItem`,
  `MenuItem`, `BranchInventory`, `StockMovement`.
- Adds `RECEIPT` to `StockMovementReason`.
- Replaces `BranchInventory (branchId, productId)` unique with two partial
  unique indexes: `(branchId, productId) WHERE productVariantId IS NULL`
  and `(branchId, productVariantId) WHERE productVariantId IS NOT NULL`.
  The swap is data-safe because `BranchInventory` holds zero rows in every
  environment — Phase 2.5 (D10) shipped the table but no code wrote to it
  until this slice, which is now its first writer.

Additive-only otherwise: no DROP TABLE, no column type change, no rename,
no data backfill. Legacy rows read unchanged. The per-migration structural
assertion lives in `provider-contract.spec.ts` and is mutation-proven by
checking the exact `CREATE TABLE` set, the exact single DROP INDEX
statement, and the presence of every additive column and FK.

## 2026-08-13 — Restaurant Product wizard + Promotions

### D45 — Restaurant tenants manage POS-sellable items from Inventory → Products; Menu admin deprecated read-only

Approved to merge Restaurant Menu Item authority into the Product wizard.
Restaurant tenants get a single admin surface (Inventory → Products) with
Restaurant-aware content in the wizard; the `/menu` admin route is removed
from Restaurant navigation. Retail (Tile Shop, Hardware) behaviour is
unchanged — the wizard's Restaurant sections render only for tenants whose
business type resolves to a Restaurant profile.

**Deprecate MenuItem read-only.**

- Existing MenuItem rows stay in the database indefinitely. The
  `GET /restaurant/menu-sections/:sectionId/items` and sibling read routes
  stay live so historical RestaurantOrder / KitchenTicket / Sale rows
  continue to render (each snapshots `menuItemName` / `unitPrice` / etc.,
  but the loose `menuItemId` reference is still used for KOT reprint,
  order detail, and receipt lookup).
- `POST` / `PATCH` / `DELETE` on menu-items and menu-sections continue to
  work at the API level for a transition period — the Restaurant admin UI
  routes to `/products` (redirect at the sidebar level; the raw routes are
  reachable if typed but no navigation exposes them).
- No auto-conversion. Tenants re-create existing menu items as Restaurant
  Products at their pace; the transition is a UX decision, not a data
  migration.

**Domain shape.**

- Restaurant-specific columns land on `Product` — `prepMinutes Int?`,
  `dietaryTags String[]`, `foodType MenuItemType?`. All nullable /
  defaulted so Retail rows stay valid with no backfill. `foodType`
  reuses the D41 `MenuItemType` enum (FOOD / BEVERAGE / DESSERT) to
  avoid a second authority.
- `ProductVariant.isDefault Boolean` marks the variant a Restaurant POS
  quick-add picks when the operator taps the product card without
  opening the picker. Uniqueness of "one default per product" is
  enforced by a partial unique index (Prisma cannot declare it).
- Two new junctions promote existing MenuItem relationships to Product:
  `ProductModifierGroup(productId, modifierGroupId, position)` and
  `ProductStationLink(productId, stationId)`. Both are peers of the
  existing MenuItem junctions; ModifierGroup rows themselves are
  tenant-scoped and reusable, so a group can be attached to both a
  Product AND a MenuItem during the transition window without a data
  copy.
- Kitchen station routing widens at KOT time: `KitchenService.
  generateTicketsForRound` reads station IDs from EITHER
  `MenuItemStationLink` OR `ProductStationLink` depending on how the
  round item was sourced. A `RestaurantOrderItem.sourceKind` (or
  equivalent discriminator) is used to pick the correct junction — DB
  schema unchanged, service resolution widened.

**Promotions vs Discounts — new peer domain.**

- New `Promotion` + `PromotionItem` models cover **scheduled auto-apply
  rules** — bundle fixed price, BOGO, %/$ discount — with day-of-week,
  time-of-day, date range, branch scope, and channel scope.
- `PromotionType`: `BUNDLE_FIXED_PRICE | BUY_X_GET_Y |
  PERCENTAGE_DISCOUNT | FIXED_AMOUNT_DISCOUNT`.
- `PromotionItemRole`: `BUY | GET | BUNDLE`.
- The existing `Discount` model stays authoritative for operator-applied
  retail line/order discounts at sale time. Promotion is its peer, not
  its replacement. No `Discount` field is renamed or migrated.
- **Server-side evaluation is the authority.** POS shows a promotion
  badge only when the server confirms the promotion is currently valid
  for the tenant, branch, channel, date, and time-of-day. Client-side
  computation is advisory (preview only).
- **Stacking policy defaults to false** — promotions do not stack unless
  explicitly allowed via `Promotion.stackable`.

**D45 scope — what ships now vs what defers.**

Per Product Owner scope decision: **models + admin CRUD + POS badge**
ship in this slice.

Ships:

- Prisma migration `20260813000000_add_restaurant_product_wizard_promotions`.
- Restaurant-aware Product wizard step 3 (Modifiers / Offers /
  Availability / Kitchen).
- Promotions admin page (`/products/promotions` under the Inventory tab
  set) with list + create + edit + activate/deactivate.
- POS Catalogue endpoint that returns active Restaurant Products with
  variants + modifier groups + station routing + a `promotions` array
  of currently-valid promotions per product.
- POS shows the promotion badge for items with an active promotion.

Defers (follow-up slice):

- Sale-close integration — freezing the promotion discount into
  `RestaurantOrderItem` snapshots, auto-inserting BOGO reward lines,
  routing reward lines to KOT, reducing stock for the reward.
- Bundle auto-collapse in the cart.
- Receipt line for the promotion discount.

**Frontend routing (D31 respected).**

- Business-profile-aware step content in the Product wizard: Restaurant
  tenants see Step 3 with Modifier Groups / Promotions / Availability /
  Kitchen Station; Retail tenants see Step 3 with the existing Pricing
  & Inventory content only.
- The `presentation.managementMode` resolver gains a `businessKind` hint
  (Restaurant vs Retail) — components never compare `businessType`
  directly, matching D31's rule.

**Backward compatibility.**

- Every existing Product row remains valid — the new columns are
  nullable / defaulted. Retail Products (no `foodType`, no `dietaryTags`)
  render exactly as they do today.
- Every existing MenuItem, RestaurantOrder, KitchenTicket, Sale, and
  Receipt continues to function against the untouched MenuItem tables
  and API.
- `POST /restaurant/orders/:orderId/rounds` gains an optional
  `sourceKind: 'MENU_ITEM' | 'PRODUCT' | 'PRODUCT_VARIANT'` field
  (default `'MENU_ITEM'`) so existing clients keep working; new
  Product-sourced round items use the new discriminator.

**Migration.** `20260813000000_add_restaurant_product_wizard_promotions`.
Purely additive: 4 new tables, 2 new enums, 3 additive Product columns,
1 additive ProductVariant column, 1 partial unique index. No DROP, no
ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL, no RENAME. `MenuItem*` and `Discount` are
untouched — the per-migration structural spec in
`provider-contract.spec.ts` enforces this via mutation-provable
negative assertions.

## 2026-08-14 — POS Product Variations in the Customise dialog

### D46 — Restaurant POS Counter's Customise dialog exposes Product Variations as a single-select radio group; round submit + KOT preserve the variation

Approved to expose the `ProductVariant` selection introduced by D44 in the
Restaurant POS Customise popup, and to unblock the last piece D45 deferred:
sending Product-sourced round items to the kitchen. Variation is a
distinct concept from Additionals (Modifiers) — the two are collected and
rendered separately, with different selection semantics.

**Two customisation concepts, deliberately separate.**

- **Variation** (Small / Medium / Large) — physically distinct sellable
  variants of the Product, each with its own absolute selling price. The
  Customise dialog renders them as a **single-select radio group**;
  selecting Large deselects Medium. Backed by `ProductVariant` rows
  created via the D44 wizard. Selling price is the variant's own
  `unitPrice` — NOT a base price + variant delta.
- **Modifier / Additional** (Extra Chicken, Extra Cheese, No Onion) —
  customisation options that add / subtract from the item price. Rendered
  as a **multi-select checkbox group** with the existing
  `ModifierGroup.selection / minSelections / maxSelections` constraints.
  Backed by `ProductModifierGroup` (D45) attaching `ModifierGroup` rows
  to the Product.

The two must not collapse into one concept — modelling Small / Medium /
Large as SIZE-role modifiers (the D41 pattern for Restaurant menu items)
was correct there but would duplicate D44's variant authority for
Products and break the cart identity + snapshot discipline this decision
requires.

**Cart identity + round submit.**

- `DraftLine` extends with `productId?`, `productVariantId?`,
  `variantName?`, `variantPrice?`. The cart continues to be a
  local-only draft — server remains the pricing authority.
- `RestaurantOrderItem` gains a `sourceKind` discriminator
  (`MENU_ITEM | PRODUCT`, default `MENU_ITEM` so every historical row
  keeps semantics), plus `productId?` + `productVariantId?` FKs and
  `variantNameSnapshot?` + `variantPriceSnapshot?` for reprint /
  receipt / audit.
- `submitRound`'s `OrderItemInputDto` gains `sourceKind` +
  `productVariantId?`. The service resolves name / price / isActive
  from EITHER `MenuItem` (legacy) OR `Product`+`ProductVariant` (D46)
  depending on the discriminator. Cross-tenant, inactive-variant,
  mismatched-variant-for-product are rejected at the service — client-
  provided price is NEVER financial authority.
- `KitchenService.generateTicketsForRound` widens station lookup: for
  a `PRODUCT`-sourced item it reads `ProductStationLink` (D45); for
  `MENU_ITEM` it reads the existing `MenuItemStationLink`. Un-routed
  items still fall to the silent `__unrouted__` bucket the earlier
  audit flagged — that is out of scope for this slice.

**KOT / snapshot discipline.**

- `KitchenTicketItem` gains a nullable `variantName?` — the KOT prints
  "MEDIUM" / "LARGE" verbatim. The kitchen must not infer the variant
  from the selling price (the brief calls this out explicitly).
- Every snapshot column on `RestaurantOrderItem` is IMMUTABLE once
  written. A later variant rename or price change cannot rewrite
  historical orders, bills, receipts, or KOT reprints.
- Sale-close (`table-sessions.service.closeSession`) reads only from
  snapshot columns, so it is source-agnostic — no change needed there.

**Default variant preselection.**

- The Customise dialog preselects the variant whose `isDefault=true`
  (D45 partial unique index guarantees at most one). When no default
  exists, selection is required; Add to Cart stays disabled with a
  hint "Select a size to continue" that appears only after the operator
  has interacted with the dialog.
- A Product with one active variant either auto-selects or hides the
  Variation section entirely (per existing "one meaningful option"
  UX). Products with zero variants render the dialog without a
  Variation section.

**Backward compatibility.**

- Every existing `RestaurantOrderItem` row remains valid — `sourceKind`
  defaults to `MENU_ITEM`, `productId` / `productVariantId` /
  `variantNameSnapshot` / `variantPriceSnapshot` all default NULL.
- The legacy MenuItem POS path (Restaurant tenants who still have
  MenuItem-based rounds during the D45 read-only-deprecate transition)
  continues to work unchanged.
- Tile Shop and other Retail tenants are unaffected — Restaurant POS
  is the only consumer.

**Migration.** `20260814000000_add_pos_variation_snapshots`. Purely
additive: one new enum, three additive columns on `RestaurantOrderItem`,
one additive column on `KitchenTicketItem`, two indexes + two FKs
(`ON DELETE SET NULL` so a Product deletion never cascades into
historical rows). No DROP, no ALTER COLUMN SET NOT NULL, no rename.
`menuItemId` stays a loose string reference exactly as before. Per-
migration structural test in `provider-contract.spec.ts` enforces the
positive shape AND the mutation-provable absence of destructive
statements.

### D47 — Table reservations by timeslot; Calendar page; `RESERVATIONS` becomes a default food-service module

Approved to let restaurant operators reserve tables for customers by
timeslot, and to add a **Calendar** navigation item where the day's
reservations are viewed on a tables × time grid, with navigation to past
and future days.

**Model.** New `TableReservation` + `ReservationStatus` enum
(`BOOKED → SEATED → COMPLETED`, terminal `CANCELLED` / `NO_SHOW`).

- Tenant/branch/table scoped, same cascade posture as `TableSession`.
- A timeslot is a half-open interval `[startAt, endAt)` chosen at booking
  (start time + duration). No fixed slot table: slots are a *rendering*
  granularity (the Calendar draws 30-minute rows), not a storage concept,
  so service hours or slot sizes can change without a migration.
- `customerId` is an **optional** FK (`ON DELETE SET NULL`);
  `customerName` / `customerPhone` are **snapshots** captured at booking.
  Phone reservations must not force creating a Customer row, and the
  calendar must render without a join and survive customer deletion —
  same snapshot discipline as `RestaurantOrderItem` (AD-15).
- `reservationNumber` `RSV-######` via the existing `DocumentSequence`
  (`'RESERVATION'` joins the `DocumentType` union; no migration needed).
- `createdByUserId` nullable-but-always-written, matching the
  `DiningArea` creator pattern. Reservations are NOT creator-owned:
  any staff member holding the permission can manage any reservation —
  a shared front-of-house book, not a personal artifact.

**Double-booking rule.** A table cannot hold two reservations in
ACTIVE states (`BOOKED`, `SEATED`) whose intervals overlap. Enforced in
the service inside the write transaction, serialized per table by a
`SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the `RestaurantTable` row — the same
row-as-mutex shape used elsewhere; two clerks booking the same table
race on the lock, and the loser gets a 409. A Postgres exclusion
constraint was rejected: Prisma cannot model it, `migrate diff` drift
checks would fight it, and the service is already the financial/state
authority everywhere else. Reservations do NOT check `TableSession`
occupancy — a table can legitimately be seated now and reserved for
later; the front of house owns that judgement.

**Permissions.** Three new active keys, `reservation:view`,
`reservation:create`, `reservation:manage` (edit / status transitions).
All three go to every food-service template that touches the floor
(`RESTAURANT_MANAGER`, `WAITER`, `RESTAURANT_CASHIER`) and to the
built-in `MANAGER` / `CASHIER` roles — a host stand cannot function if
cancelling a booking needs a manager. OWNER/ADMIN derive as usual.

**Module gating.** Routes live under `@RequireModule(ModuleKey.RESERVATIONS)`.
`RESERVATIONS` **moves from opt-in to the default food-service module
set** — the Release 1 / Release 2 boundary in `platform.constants.ts`
moves deliberately: reservations are now part of the pilot scope. The
two assertions that pinned it out of the defaults
(`business-profile.service.spec.ts`, `platform.constants.spec.ts`) are
updated citing this decision (permitted per D16: a decision record says
otherwise). Retail tenants are untouched — the module is food-service
only.

**Calendar page.** New `/calendar` route + nav item (Service group,
gated `module: RESERVATIONS`, `permission: reservation:view`). Day view:
tables grouped by dining area on one axis, the service day as 30-minute
slots on the other; reservations render as blocks spanning their
interval. Prev / Today / Next plus a date input reach past and future
days (past days are read-only history — no new bookings in the past).
Clicking an empty slot opens the booking dialog pre-filled with that
table + time; clicking a block opens edit / seat / cancel / no-show.
The API lists by explicit `[from, to)` instants supplied by the client —
the server does not guess the display timezone.

**Deferred, deliberately.** Linking a seated reservation to the
`TableSession` it becomes (would give per-cover analytics; lands
additively later). Deposits/prepayment. Guest-facing booking. Reminder
messaging. Capacity-aware overbooking warnings.

**Migration.** `20260815000000_add_table_reservations`. Purely additive:
one new enum, one new table, indexes + FKs (`ON DELETE CASCADE` from
tenant/branch/table like `TableSession`; `SET NULL` for customer and
creator). No DROP, no column changes to existing tables.

### D48 — Email + password is the only login path; PINs are approval-only

The login page's Cashier PIN box and the `POST /auth/pin-login` endpoint are
removed. Signing in — web form or API — requires an email and password,
workspace-scoped as before (Slice 8.2). Requested by the Product Owner with
the login redesign.

**What PINs still do.** In-POS approval prompts (discount over the cap,
returns) keep verifying PINs via `findUserByPin` — that is an *authenticated*
check inside a session, not a way to mint one. Seeded users keep their PINs
for exactly that purpose.

**What went with the endpoint.** The device-commissioning tenant memory
(Slice 8.8 `rememberTenant`/`recallTenant`) existed only so a pre-auth PIN
POST could name its tenant; with the endpoint gone it is deleted, along with
the `pin-login` throttle policy and its rate-limit keys. Workspace memory
(the slug prefill) is unrelated and stays.

**Seed consequence.** Roles that previously logged in by PIN now carry
email + password in the dev seed (`manager@` / `cashier@hardwarepos.test`,
`restaurant.cashier@axlopos.test`); their PINs remain as approval PINs.
Slice 8.8's WS-201/202 acceptance rows are superseded by this decision —
the tenant-boundary claim they made is now asserted through
workspace-scoped email login instead.

**Continuation — the workspace field goes too.** The login form asks only
for email and password; the workspace is identified from the email. The
`AUTH_WORKSPACE_REQUIRED` flow (Slice 8.2) survives as progressive
disclosure: the field renders ONLY after the server answers that the email
lives in more than one workspace — otherwise a duplicate-email user would
be locked out with no recourse. `?workspace=` deep links are still
honoured, silently. The per-device workspace memory is deleted with the
visible field: silently replaying a stale remembered slug would fail a
valid login with no visible cause (a slug narrows the search, never widens
it — WS-104).

### D49 — Open tables: ad-hoc joined tables with auto-release on bill close

Approved for the situation the PO described: a party of six, no six-top
free, so the floor joins a four-top and a two-top. The joined arrangement
is an **open table** — named by the operator, optionally carrying a seat
count, seatable like any table, and dissolved automatically when its bill
closes.

**Model: an open table IS a RestaurantTable.** `RestaurantTableKind`
(`PHYSICAL` default | `OPEN`) discriminates. This keeps the entire session
stack — open session → orders → rounds → KOT → bill — working on open
tables with zero changes: `TableSession.tableId` points at it like any
other table. The alternative (a separate entity) would have forked every
downstream flow.

- `capacity` and `areaId` become **nullable** (widening only): an open
  table has "no registered seating capacity" unless the operator records
  one, and it belongs to no floor plan area. Physical-table creation still
  requires both — enforced at the service, where the invariant actually
  lives; the columns carry the honest shape.
- `code` is auto-assigned (`OPEN-<n>` via the tenant's `DocumentSequence`)
  — the operator names the table via `label`; codes exist for staff
  vocabulary and uniqueness, not for data entry.
- `OpenTableMember` joins the open table to the physical tables it
  absorbs. Membership rows are deleted on release; history lives in the
  audit log, not in tombstones.

**RESERVED is a new table status.** Members go `RESERVED` on creation and
back to `AVAILABLE` on release — the PO's vocabulary, now a first-class
`RestaurantTableStatus` value. `openSession` refuses a RESERVED table
outright: a joined member must not be seatable on its own, otherwise the
reservation is decorative. (This is the first status check in
`openSession`; the pre-existing looseness around OCCUPIED is untouched.)

**Member eligibility.** AVAILABLE + active + `PHYSICAL` only, at least
one, all on the open table's branch, checked inside the create
transaction. A table already absorbed into one open table cannot join a
second.

**Lifecycle.** Create (members → RESERVED) → seat → order → bill. On
`closeSession` of an open table's session, in the same transaction: every
member returns to AVAILABLE, memberships are deleted, and the open-table
row is archived (`isActive=false`) — the arrangement ends with the tab,
which is what "special situations" means. An open table that was never
seated (the party left) is dissolved manually; dissolve refuses while a
live session exists.

**Permission.** One new active key, `open-table:manage` (create +
dissolve). Front-of-house, like the reservation book: MANAGER, CASHIER,
and the RESTAURANT_MANAGER / WAITER / RESTAURANT_CASHIER templates. NOT
creator-owned — joining tables is a shift decision, not floor
administration (deliberately unlike D-series `TABLE_CREATE`, which stays
OWNER-only).

**Out of scope, deliberately.** Reservations (D47) on open tables — the
reservation service now refuses non-PHYSICAL tables; a transient
arrangement has no business on the calendar. Auto-suggesting which tables
to join. Cross-branch joins.

**Migration.** `20260816000000_add_open_tables`: `RESERVED` enum value,
`RestaurantTableKind` enum + `kind` column (default PHYSICAL),
`capacity` / `areaId` DROP NOT NULL (widening — every existing row remains
valid), `OpenTableMember` table with cascade FKs. No DROP, no SET NOT
NULL, no rename; the widenings are named explicitly in the
provider-contract structural test.

### D50 — One physical table may back several open tables; release is last-one-out, with a manual early release

Supersedes D49's "one live membership per physical table". The PO's two
worked examples:

- **Two parties, one table.** A four-top is free; two unrelated pairs
  arrive. The waiter creates **two** open tables, each reserving the same
  four-top. Each party gets its own tab. The four-top returns to
  AVAILABLE when the **last** of the two bills closes.
- **Two parties, two joined tables.** Two parties of three; a four-top
  and a two-top remain. Both are joined, and **both** open tables reserve
  **both** tables. When the first party is billed, the two-top *can* be
  freed — the remaining three fit on the four-top — but only a human
  knows that. So the system asks rather than assumes.

**Membership is many-to-many.** `OpenTableMember`'s
`@@unique([memberTableId])` is dropped; `@@unique([openTableId,
memberTableId])` stays, so a table still cannot be added twice to the
*same* open table.

**Eligibility widens by exactly one status.** A member may now be
`AVAILABLE` **or** `RESERVED` (already held by another open table).
Everything else is still refused: SEATED / OCCUPIED / BILLING / CLEANING
/ BLOCKED, archived rows, and `kind = OPEN`. A table with a party
physically at it is not shareable; a table already shared is.

**Release is last-one-out, and only that is automatic.** `closeSession`
deletes the closing open table's own memberships and archives that open
table, then returns each former member to AVAILABLE **only if no live
membership remains**. A member still held by another open table stays
RESERVED. This is the rule that makes example 1 correct without a prompt
and example 2 refuse to guess.

**Manual early release is the escape hatch.** `POST
.../tables/:tableId/release` drops every live membership for one physical
table and returns it to AVAILABLE. It exists because the server cannot
know whether the parties still occupying an arrangement physically need
all of its tables — compaction is a floor judgement. Deliberately
permitted even when it strips the last member of a live open table: the
alternative is inventing a rule that blocks a real compaction, and the
server has no way to verify the room.

**Billing reminds, it does not decide.** The close response carries a
release summary — which members were auto-released, and which stay
RESERVED with the open tables still holding them. When anything stays
reserved, the web app interrupts the close→bill navigation with a dialog
listing those tables and offering release inline. The dialog is a
decision point, not a notification: dismissing it continues to the bill
unchanged.

**"Connected to an open table" must be legible.** A RESERVED table on the
floor names the open tables holding it ("Held by Party A, Party B"), and
the Unreserve action renders **only** for tables with a live open-table
membership. A table reserved for any other reason is therefore never
offered an unreserve control — the PO's stated failure mode (releasing
something that was not an open-table hold) cannot be reached from the UI.
The held-by map is derived client-side from the open-table list the floor
already loads; no table-listing endpoint changes.

**Migration.** `20260817000000_share_open_table_members`: drops one unique
index. Data-safe and widening — every row satisfying the old constraint
satisfies the new one. Named explicitly in the provider-contract test,
which asserts the pair-unique survives.

### D51 — Bills split by item: a split carries the lines it covers, and its share is derived

A group of friends wants a bill each for exactly what they ate. The
operator opens the closed tab's bill, assigns each line to a named split,
and every split becomes a separately payable, separately printable bill.

**Item-backed splits, derived shares.** `BillSplitItem` joins a
`BillSplit` to a `RestaurantOrderItem` with an assigned `quantity`, so a
line of "3 × Beer" can go 2/1 across two friends. `BillSplit.share` stops
being an operator input on this path and becomes a **computed** figure —
the server owns the money, as everywhere else.

**Both split modes coexist.** The existing amount-based `setSplits`
(even split, arbitrary tenders) is untouched and still valid for "just
halve it". `splitByItems` is the new path. A split created by amount has
no items; a split created by items always does. Nothing about the
existing endpoint changes.

**Share = items + a proportional slice of everything else.** A split's
share is its own line totals plus its pro-rata share of the difference
between the sale's subtotal and its total — service charge, tax,
packaging, discounts, whatever the tenant configured — weighted by the
split's item subtotal. Rounding uses **largest remainder**: shares are
rounded to 2dp and the leftover cent goes to the split with the biggest
fractional part, so `Σ shares == total` **exactly**, always. A zero-value
tab (all items comped) spreads the extras evenly by the same method
rather than dividing by zero.

**Every unit must be assigned.** `splitByItems` refuses unless the
assigned quantities for each line sum exactly to that line's quantity.
Partial assignment would make `Σ shares == total` false, which is the one
invariant the payment path already depends on. The UI tracks what is left
and blocks save until nothing is.

**Splitting is refused once money has moved.** Any collected payment
makes the sale ineligible for re-splitting — reallocating shares under a
recorded tender is an accounting mess with no honest answer. Split
first, then collect.

**Payments allocate to a split.** `collectPayment` takes an optional
`splitId` and increments that split's `paidAmount`, refusing more than
the split's own remaining balance. This closes a real gap: the bill
screen's "Collect for split" button already captured a split id and
never sent it, so split `paidAmount` could never move off zero and every
tender landed against the whole sale.

**No new Sale rows, deliberately.** One tab stays one financial record;
the splits are views of it that can each be paid and printed. Minting a
Sale per split would double-count revenue unless the parent were voided,
and would renumber and re-date financial documents for a presentation
concern. Restaurant tenants run no accounting provider (D2), so there is
nothing that needs a separate Sale to reconcile against. If per-split
Sales are ever genuinely required, the item assignment recorded here is
what they would be built from.

**Migration.** `20260818000000_add_bill_split_items`: one new table with
cascade FKs. Purely additive — no existing table is touched, and a bill
with no item assignments behaves exactly as it does today.

### D52 — Restaurant bills compute tax, packaging and per-channel service charge; sales are attributed to the real actor

The audit in [`hardcoded-audit.md`](./hardcoded-audit.md) found the restaurant
close path hardcoding `taxAmount: 0`, `packagingCharge: 0` and `totalDiscount:
0`, levying service charge on dine-in only by accident rather than by
configuration, and attributing every sale to `findFirst` results. This
decision fixes the money and the attribution.

**One totals calculator, shared by every channel.** `restaurant-totals.ts` is
pure and dependency-free (the `split-shares.ts` pattern): given a subtotal, a
channel and the branch/tenant configuration it returns service charge,
packaging, tax and total. `closeSession` and the takeaway handover both call
it, which is what stops the two channels drifting — today dine-in charges
service and takeaway silently does not.

**Tax comes from the existing `AppSettings.taxRatePercent`,** read through the
synchronous cache-backed `SettingsService.getSettings` that retail already uses
(`sales.service.ts:410`). No new tax setting is introduced.

**`taxInclusive` stays unhonoured — deliberately, and now documented.** The
setting exists but is read by *nothing* in the platform, retail included.
Implementing tax-inclusive pricing only for restaurants would make the two
channels compute differently from the same tenant setting, which is worse than
the current honest gap. It is recorded in the audit as an open item for a
platform-wide slice.

**Three new branch config fields, each replacing a hardcoded assumption:**

- `serviceChargeChannels RestaurantOrderChannel[]`, default `[DINE_IN]` —
  makes today's implicit behaviour explicit and configurable. A restaurant
  that levies service on takeaway can now say so.
- `packagingChargeAmount Decimal(12,2)`, default `0` — a flat per-order charge
  applied to TAKEAWAY and ONLINE. The `Sale.packagingCharge` column and the
  bill row already existed with nothing to fill them; the schema comment
  already named this as the missing config.
- `serviceChargeTaxable Boolean`, default `true` — whether service charge sits
  inside the taxable base. This genuinely varies by jurisdiction and cannot be
  guessed; `true` matches Sri Lankan practice, which is the pilot market.

**Attribution: the actor, not a query result.**

- `closeSession` now takes `actorUserId`. It was the only method in its class
  that did not, while its controller already held `actor.id`. The cashier is
  `session.waiterUserId ?? actorUserId` — never `findFirst` on `User`, which
  was not branch-scoped and in practice booked every untagged sale to the
  tenant owner.
- The register is taken from an optional `registerId` on the close DTO,
  validated to belong to the session's branch. Absent one, the fallback is
  the branch's first active register **ordered by code** — deterministic,
  where the previous `findFirstOrThrow` had no `orderBy` at all and could
  return a different till between two closes. Binding a register to a device
  at login is the real answer and is deferred to its own slice; this removes
  the non-determinism without inventing that feature.

**Deferred, with reasons rather than silence:**

- **Promotion pricing at close.** Promotions are badged on the POS catalogue
  and never discount the bill. This is not a small wiring gap: the promotions
  module exports only `isPromotionActive`, an activity-window predicate. There
  is no promotion *pricing* engine anywhere, so applying them is a feature to
  design, not a bug to fix.
- **Manual order-level discounts.** Retail resolves these with a manager
  approval threshold; the restaurant equivalent needs the same approval flow
  plus a UI, and belongs with promotion pricing.
- **`Sale.status: COMPLETED` before payment.** A restaurant bill legitimately
  exists unpaid — `paymentStatus: UNPAID` already records that. Moving it to
  `DRAFT` would change which sales every existing report, the returns path and
  the QuickBooks sync can see. That is a financial-state redesign needing its
  own decision and a data story, not a line change inside this one.

**Migration.** `20260819000000_add_restaurant_charge_config`: three additive
columns on `RestaurantBranchConfig`, all defaulted so every existing branch
keeps its current behaviour exactly.

### D54 — Money is formatted in the tenant's currency; the vendor's brand never appears on a tenant's document

Audit section F plus D5/D6. Three fallbacks put "Hardware POS" or "Axlo POS"
onto documents a customer keeps, and every money formatter on the restaurant
surface rendered `LKR` regardless of what the tenant had configured.

**`AppSettings.currency` is honoured, not defaulted past.** It has existed and
been API-writable all along. `utils.formatMoney` named its parameter
`_currency` and discarded it — while `pos/payment/page.tsx` genuinely fetched
the setting and passed it in. `labels.formatMoney` defaulted to the literal
`'LKR'`, and since no call site passes a currency, that default was what every
tenant got.

**Resolved once per shell, read synchronously.** Money is formatted in dozens
of render paths that cannot each await the settings API, so `tenant-money.ts`
caches the resolved code in module memory and LocalStorage — the same pattern
`document-template-service` already uses for the document profile.
`PlatformProfileProvider` primes it, and signing out forgets it, because the
next user on the device may belong to a tenant trading in another currency.

**Only LKR keeps a display symbol.** `Rs.` is LKR-specific; every other
currency renders as its ISO code. Inventing a symbol per currency would be
worse than an honest `AED 1,250.00`, and the pilot's output is unchanged.

**An unset company name renders empty, not as the vendor's brand.** A blank
letterhead is visibly wrong to whoever is about to print it. "Hardware POS" on
a tax document is not — it looks like a real company, and it is the wrong one.

**The split bill I shipped in D51 printed bare decimals with no currency at
all** — the only customer-facing document in the app without a unit — and
computed its balance in the browser with `.toFixed(2)`. Both fixed here.

Branch and register names in the three POS shells were the literals
`"Main Dining"` and `"Counter 1"`; they now come from the session.

### D55 — Platform admins: a cross-tenant account that manages workspaces and users, and never reads tenant business data

A new account type that signs in through the same login page and lands on a
platform console instead of a workspace. It creates workspaces from a
template, and manages user accounts inside any workspace.

**The security problem this creates.** Every JWT in this system carries a
`tenantId`, and that one field is what `@TenantId()` turns into the isolation
boundary on every route. A platform admin belongs to no workspace, so the
boundary has to be re-stated rather than inherited.

**A bidirectional guard, not a privilege escalation.** `User.isPlatformAdmin`
marks the account; platform routes carry `@PlatformAdminRoute()`. A global
`PlatformBoundaryGuard` enforces both directions:

- a non-platform token on a platform route → 403;
- **a platform token on any tenant-scoped route → 403.**

The second half is the important one. A platform admin's token is refused by
every existing route in the product, so "cannot read tenant business data" is
a property of the guard rather than of the endpoints we remembered to check.
Platform admins live in a dedicated `platform` tenant so the `User.tenantId`
FK stays satisfied and the whole auth stack — password hashing, refresh
rotation, login throttling — is reused rather than duplicated.

**Password reset is a deliberate hole in that boundary, and is logged like
one.** The PO chose full user CRUD including password resets. A platform
admin can therefore reset a workspace owner's password and sign in as them,
which reaches the business data the guard otherwise refuses. This is a
support-desk capability with a master-key shape, so: every reset writes an
audit record naming the actor, the target user and the workspace, and the
reset endpoint is the only one in the platform module that touches
credentials. The metadata-only boundary is real protection against accident
and casual browsing; it is not a defence against a malicious platform admin,
and should not be described as one.

**Templates are business types, because that mechanism already exists.**
`BusinessType` already drives `NAV_BY_BUSINESS_TYPE`, `DEFAULT_MODULES_BY_
BUSINESS_TYPE`, `BUSINESS_PROFILE_PRESETS` and the role templates. A template
is therefore a named business type plus its presets, not a new entity: three
are offered — Hardware, Restaurant, Hotel.

**HOTEL is its own business type that currently aliases Restaurant.** The PO
asked for a duplicate of the restaurant template. Aliasing at the *map* level
(HOTEL → `RESTAURANT_NAV`, restaurant modules, restaurant role templates)
rather than reusing the `RESTAURANT` value means the workspaces are
distinguishable in data from day one, and the day hotels need their own
navigation it is a one-line map change instead of a migration over live
tenants. `BUSINESS_PROFILE_PRESETS` is a total `Record<BusinessType, …>`, so
the compiler required every map to answer for HOTEL — which is the point.

**Provisioning reuses the proven path.** Creating a workspace runs the same
sequence as `provision-tenant.ts`: tenant, business profile, main branch,
register, role rows for the template's business type, and an owner user. It
is one transaction, so a half-built workspace cannot exist.

**Migration.** `20260820000000_add_platform_admin_and_hotel`: the `HOTEL`
enum value and `User.isPlatformAdmin` (defaulted false, so no existing user
gains anything).

**The console is its own route tree, and the two shells push each other
apart.** `/platform` sits outside the `(app)` group because that layout mounts
the sidebar, the module gate and the POS cart providers, all of which assume a
tenant — a platform admin inside it would 403 on the profile fetch and land in
front of a broken shell. So `Protected` sends a platform admin to `/platform`
and the platform layout sends a workspace user to `/dashboard`. Neither is a
security control (the guard already refuses both tokens); they exist so nobody
reaches a shell that cannot load. `platform-boundary.render.test.tsx` asserts
both directions and is mutation-proven: dropping the workspace→console half
fails exactly one test and leaves the other six green.

**The console shows the role that is actually in force.** A user linked to a
custom workspace role keeps an enum role underneath — the seeded waiter is enum
`CASHIER` — and `PermissionResolver` uses the linked role. Listing only the
enum would tell an operator that a waiter is a cashier, so the workspace role
is named separately and the enum select is labelled as its fallback.

**D55.1 — the role a new user gets is the workspace's own, not a fixed five.**
The console shipped with `['OWNER','ADMIN','MANAGER','CASHIER','ACCOUNTANT']`
written into the Add-user dialog and into the DTO's `@IsIn`. That list is
correct for a hardware workspace, which is what made it survivable: it could
not assign `WAITER` — the role a restaurant workspace exists to assign — and
`role: dto.role as UserRole` would have written an invalid enum value if it
ever received one.

The roles now come from `GET /platform-admin/workspaces/:id/roles`, read from
the workspace's own `Role` rows. Which rows exist was already decided by the
template: `seedTenantRoles` gives a food-service workspace the restaurant
roles on top of the five built-ins — eleven in total, not the two the request
sketched — and a hardware workspace five. The rows are also what
`PermissionResolver` consults, and a tenant may have renamed one, so reading
them beats deriving the list from the templates a second time.

**Addressed by id, not by key.** `Role.key` is nullable — documented as
nullable only so the column could be added without a backfill — so a
key-addressed console would silently fail to offer any role lacking one. The
id is what `User.roleId` stores anyway, and the lookup is scoped by
`tenantId` as well as `id` so a role from another workspace cannot be
attached even if its id is known.

**The enum column still matters, so the fallback is CASHIER.** A user on a
custom role must still store something in `User.role`. It is not inert:
`BranchScopeGuard` and `UsersService` treat OWNER/ADMIN as cross-branch and
`QuotationsService` gates admin actions on it, and it is what
`LEGACY_FALLBACK` resolves from if the linked role row is later deleted.
`baseUserRoleFor` therefore maps a built-in key to itself and everything else
to the least-privileged built-in, so both paths fail closed: a waiter does not
gain cross-branch visibility from a column that had to hold a value, and does
not inherit manager permissions if their role row goes away. This matches what
the seed already does for the restaurant waiter.

**An unknown role is a 400, never a silent null.** The earlier code fell back
to `roleId: null` when the key did not match, which fails *open* — the user
would resolve from the enum instead, so a typo produced a working cashier
rather than an error. The lookup now refuses, naming the workspace's actual
roles.

Verified live: a waiter created through the console resolves to a permission
set identical to the seeded waiter's; a hardware workspace is refused the
waiter role and a restaurant workspace is refused a hardware role. The picker
is mutation-proven — reintroducing the hardcoded five fails two of the five
render tests while the hardware-only assertion stays green, which is exactly
the asymmetry that let the original bug through.

**Known gap, deliberately not closed here.** The seeded hardware tenant
(`tnt_dev`) has no `TenantBusinessProfile` row at all: it resolves through
`LEGACY_TENANT_DEFAULTS` to `TILE_SHOP`/QuickBooks. It is therefore linked to
no template, and the console says so — "Legacy default" — rather than implying
a Hardware template it does not have. Writing it a `HARDWARE` profile would
keep the inventory/accounting pair identical but would change its business
type and swap the legacy 13-module list for the HARDWARE default set, which is
a behavioural change to the live retail product. That needs its own decision
and its own verification, so it is not bundled into this one.

## 2026-08-14 — Convergence Phase 0

### D56 — Domain packs: one descriptor per vertical; capabilities replace business-type comparisons

Implements Phase 0 of [`docs/convergence-plan.md`](../convergence-plan.md)
(§4, §5). Adding a vertical used to touch fifteen places, eleven of which
failed silently — `NAV_BY_BUSINESS_TYPE[t] ?? RETAIL_NAV` handed an unknown
domain the retail rail, `resolveBusinessKind` fell back to retail chrome, and
six page bodies compared `businessType` inline. HOTEL shipped missing seven of
them, which is how a hotel workspace got the restaurant sidebar with the
retail POS behind it.

**Domain packs.** `packages/shared/src/domains/` holds one `DomainDescriptor`
per vertical (hardware, food-service, hotel, general) declaring label,
template copy, profile preset, module set, navigation (as data, icons by
name), role templates and capabilities. `DOMAIN_REGISTRY` is a total
`Record<BusinessType, DomainDescriptor>` with **no fallback**: a value without
an entry is a compile error, never a wrong screen. The seven scattered maps
(`BUSINESS_PROFILE_PRESETS`, `DEFAULT_MODULES_BY_BUSINESS_TYPE`,
`BUSINESS_TYPE_LABELS`, `NAV_BY_BUSINESS_TYPE`,
`roleTemplatesForBusinessType`, `WORKSPACE_TEMPLATES`, the web `BusinessType`
union) become derivations or re-exports of the registry.

**Capabilities.** `TenantCapabilities` — what a tenant's users can actually do
(catalogue.variants/modifiers/preparation, fulfilment.kind/channels, charges,
documents) — is declared per descriptor and returned on
`GET /v1/platform/profile`. Pages and services read a capability, never a
business type; D31's rule generalised from the product screens to the whole
platform. Capabilities are affordances only: the server still refuses what the
guard refuses. Unshipped features (`collections`, `components`) are declared
`false` until their phase flips them.

**Hotel re-declares, never aliases.** `hotel.domain.ts` re-declares the
food-service values (Q7): a redundant-looking file today is a one-file edit
when hotels diverge; an alias would be a refactor. A parity spec pins the
values equal until a divergence is a visible edit.

**The web unions move to `@hardware-pos/shared`.** The web must never import
the Prisma client, so it hand-maintained copies of `BusinessType`/`ModuleKey`,
guarded by a regex over source text that broke twice during D55. The shared
package is browser-safe; the unions live there once as `as const` arrays with
derived types, and the API contract spec compares them against the Prisma
enums **at runtime**, both directions, no regex.

### D57 — One business type per template: the pilot is HARDWARE; TILE_SHOP and RETAIL are removed

> **Partly superseded by D120 (2026-08-28).** `RETAIL` returns as its own business
> type and domain descriptor, for a clothing customer that did not exist in
> August. The Tile Shop finding below and the `TILE_SHOP` removal **stand
> unchanged**.

PO decision (2026-08-14): the Hardware template and the Tile Shop are the same
entity, and there is no Retail template. (Plan §4.8.1; plan-appendix id D71.)

The `BusinessType` enum was ten days old and the three retail values carried
**zero data** — `TenantBusinessProfile.businessType` is the enum's only column
and no row held `TILE_SHOP`, `HARDWARE` or `RETAIL`; the pilot tenant has no
profile row and resolved through `LEGACY_TENANT_DEFAULTS` (code, not data). So
the values are removed outright rather than deprecated: a transition for
ghosts protects nothing.

- `LEGACY_TENANT_DEFAULTS.businessType` and the
  `business-profile.repository` write-fallback repoint `TILE_SHOP` →
  `HARDWARE`. Verified behaviour-preserving: HARDWARE's default module set is
  exactly the legacy 13-module list and the provider pair is identical. The
  one visible change is the Settings → Business label reading "Hardware
  store" instead of "Tile shop". (The D55 "known gap" note assumed the module
  lists might differ; they are the same set — that note is corrected by this
  record.)
- The pilot tenant is **classified for real**: an explicit
  `TenantBusinessProfile` row (`HARDWARE`, `QUICKBOOKS`/`QUICKBOOKS`) written
  by `packages/database/prisma/backfill-pilot-profile.ts` — an operational
  script with a production guard, never part of `migrate deploy`. This closes
  D55's "Legacy default" console gap: the pilot shows as a Hardware-template
  workspace because it genuinely is one.
- **Migration** `20260821000000_remove_tile_shop_and_retail_business_types`:
  recreates the enum without the two values (Postgres cannot `DROP` an enum
  value in place). Non-additive by nature — this record is its authorisation,
  and the per-migration proof in `provider-contract.spec.ts` scopes an
  explicit exception for exactly this recreation while continuing to forbid
  every other destructive shape. The migration refuses to run if any row
  carries a removed value.
- Existing specs that passed `'TILE_SHOP'` to role seeding are mechanically
  renamed to `'HARDWARE'` under this record (their assertions are unchanged —
  both values always resolved to identical roles).

### D58 — The settlement document is universal: every completed transaction writes SaleItem rows

Implements Phase 1 of [`docs/convergence-plan.md`](../convergence-plan.md)
(§3.2, §8.1–8.2, §12.3.2). A restaurant sale wrote a `Sale` header with zero
`SaleItem` rows, which made returns, item-level reporting, receipts and
accounting sync structurally retail-only and forced a parallel reporting
stack over `RestaurantOrderItem`.

**The projection.** Closing a table session (and handing over a takeaway) now
projects every non-voided order item into a `SaleItem` inside the SAME
transaction that creates the `Sale` — a field-for-field copy of the snapshots
frozen at submit time, never a recomputation. A `SaleItemModifier` child
mirrors `RestaurantOrderItemModifier` the same way. An in-transaction
invariant asserts `Σ lineTotal == subtotal`; a close that fails it aborts
rather than persisting a document that disagrees with itself.

**New columns.** `SaleItem`: `sourceKind` (`RETAIL_CART` default, so every
existing retail row keeps its meaning; `RESTAURANT_ORDER_ITEM` for projected
lines), `sourceItemId` (typed by sourceKind, never reused for another
entity — the lesson of D-6's polymorphic `menuItemId`), `modifierTotal`,
`notes`, `backfilledAt`. `Sale`: `fulfilmentKind` (default `IMMEDIATE`),
`channel` (default `COUNTER` — correct for every existing retail sale, which
is why those defaults were chosen), `sourceRefKind`/`sourceRefId`, and
`servedByUserId` (open decision Q6, resolved per the plan's recommendation:
`cashierId` keeps meaning "who took the money", `servedByUserId` is who
served the table — loose reference, no FK, so serving staff churn never
blocks a settlement write).

**`SaleItem.productId` becomes nullable** — the one widening `ALTER` in the
migration. A projected line from a legacy MenuItem has no product; the
snapshots carry the document's meaning. The per-migration proof in
`provider-contract.spec.ts` scopes `DROP NOT NULL` as permitted for exactly
this migration while `SET NOT NULL` stays forbidden everywhere.

**Historical backfill (open decision Q1, resolved: yes).**
`prisma/backfill-restaurant-sale-items.ts` reconstructs `SaleItem` rows for
already-closed sessions from `TableSession.finalSaleId → RestaurantOrder →
RestaurantOrderItem` — dry-run first, idempotent, every reconstructed row
stamped `backfilledAt`, and a per-sale sum invariant under which a
discrepant sale gets NO rows and a report line instead: a wrong
reconstruction is worse than an absent one. Run as an operational step,
never inside `migrate deploy`.

**Explicitly deferred, with reasons.** (a) Pointing `billing.service`'s
settled-bill reads at `SaleItem`: `BillSplitItem` anchors splits to
`RestaurantOrderItem` ids, and switching the read source while splits are
mid-flight risks live bills for zero user-visible gain until the shared
consumers (returns, receipts) actually read the projection — revisit in
Phase 5 with the reports re-backing. (b) Restaurant returns through the
shared `ReturnsService`: the RETURNS module is not in the food-service
module set, so no UI can reach it; enabling the path without the module
decision would be dead code asserting nothing.

### D59 — One money engine, `Prisma.Decimal` throughout, for sales, bills and quotations

Implements Phase 2 of the convergence plan (§8.7, §13.3). Three calculators
existed: retail sales and quotations computed money in binary floating point
with `round2()` at each step; the restaurant bill used `Prisma.Decimal`
(D52). `computeDocumentTotals` (`common/money/document-totals.ts`) is now the
superset pipeline — line discounts + order discount + service charge +
packaging + tax — and all three callers delegate to it:

- `restaurant-totals.ts` became a thin wrapper whose unchanged D52 spec is
  the parity proof for the food-service half.
- `quotations.calc.ts` and `sales.service.ts` delegate at a number boundary
  (exact — every engine output is a 2dp figure); their unchanged specs are
  the parity proof for the retail half.

**The differential proof, and the one recorded behaviour change.** The spec
preserves the legacy float formulas verbatim and runs both engines over
5,000 seeded carts. Measured result: wherever no intermediate sits on an
exact half-cent, the engines agree to the cent, unconditionally. AT an exact
half-cent the float engine's answer depended on the value's magnitude — the
`+ Number.EPSILON` nudge rescued small figures (10% of 19.85 → 1.99, both
engines agree) but is below one ulp for large ones (15% of 15,185.50 = 
2,277.825 exactly; float computed 227782.49999999997 and charged 2,277.82).
The Decimal engine rounds every mathematical half up: **at exact half-cent
boundaries a total can change by one cent, upward, and that is the defect
(plan D-7) being fixed, not a regression.** Pinned in the spec so it cannot
regress into silence. Existing behavioural assertions were NOT edited — all
pinned totals in the sales/quotations/restaurant specs pass unchanged.

**Per-branch tax (plan Q5, resolved per recommendation).**
`RestaurantBranchConfig.taxRatePercent` — nullable; NULL inherits the
tenant-wide `TenantSettings.taxRatePercent`; 0 is a real rate and stays
distinguishable from unset. Wired into both restaurant close paths. No UI
yet, deliberately.

**Migrations.** `20260823000000_add_branch_tax_rate_override` (one nullable
column). The settlement migration is D58's.

### D60 — `Product` is the only catalogue; `MenuItem` becomes a placement and is frozen

Implements Phase 3 of the convergence plan (§8.3, §8.5–8.6, §8.9, §12.3.3).
D45 made `Product` the authoring surface but left `MenuItem` alive as a
complete second catalogue with its own name, price, image, modifiers and
station routing, and a `sourceKind` discriminator threaded through every
consumer. This decision finishes the convergence.

**`Product.sellableKind`** — AxloPOS's own vocabulary for what a sellable
thing IS (`STOCK_ITEM` default / `COMPOSED_ITEM` / `SERVICE` / `BUNDLE`,
with `TIME_SLOT` and `STAY_UNIT` named now, unused, so nobody invents
`Product.type = 'Room'` later). Distinct from the QuickBooks `type` string
(provider data, untouched) and from `foodType` (presentation). Backfill
maps `type = 'Service'` → SERVICE and D45 restaurant products carrying a
`foodType` → COMPOSED_ITEM — a component-less COMPOSED_ITEM depletes 1:1,
so packaged drinks marked COMPOSED lose nothing.

**`CatalogueEntry`** — the thin placement `MenuItem` actually was: which
product appears in which menu section, in what order, optionally at what
price. `priceOverride` is the ONLY price a placement may own, and it is an
override of the product's price, never a second authority (plan P1).
`CatalogueAvailability` and `CatalogueChannelPrice` re-home the placement
concerns. `MenuItem.migratedProductId` records the mapping for audit and
for the order-item backfill.

**Backfill (plan Q2, resolved: auto-create).**
`backfill-catalogue-convergence.ts`, dry-run first: linked menu items get a
`CatalogueEntry` (+ junction copies for modifier groups and station links);
UNLINKED menu items get a new `Product` first (scalars copied,
`sellableKind = COMPOSED_ITEM`), with a case-insensitive duplicate-name
report for the tenant to merge — D45's "no auto-conversion" was about not
forcing UX change, not about stranding data. Historical
`RestaurantOrderItem` rows with `sourceKind = MENU_ITEM` get `productId`
stamped from the mapping.

**Transitional pricing rule.** A MENU_ITEM-sourced order line now resolves
its price as `CatalogueEntry.priceOverride ?? Product.unitPrice`, falling
back to the frozen `basePrice` only for an unmigrated item. At backfill
time these are equal by construction (the override is written only where
`basePrice` differed); afterwards the product price is authoritative —
which is the point. Item writes (`POST`/`PATCH` menu items, sections,
menus) return `410 Gone` naming the successor; reads stay for reprints and
the support-only legacy browser.

**Kitchen routing** prefers `ProductStationLink` whenever the order line
carries a `productId` (all lines, after backfill) and keeps the
`MenuItemStationLink` fallback only for unmigrated legacy rows.

**Frozen, not dropped.** `MenuItem` and its children stop being written and
stay readable indefinitely; the drop is a separate decision two releases
out, per the plan's deferred-drops rule.

### D61 — `FulfilmentProvider`: the third provider axis, alongside inventory and accounting

Implements Phase 4 of the convergence plan (§4.5). A fulfilment provider owns
HOW a sale comes into being — the operational lifecycle between "the customer
wants this" and "the money settled" — while the settlement document
(`Sale`/`SaleItem`, D58) stays Layer-1 invariant core. This is the phase the
plan's extension contract rests on (its risk register R9 warned it would feel
skippable): a future vertical's lifecycle — an appointment, a room-night, a
repair job — becomes one class implementing one interface, its own
operational tables, its own routes, and NOTHING else, because settlement,
reporting, receipts and returns consume `SaleItem`.

**The interface.** `collectSettlementLines(tx, tenantId, ref)` returns
not-yet-settled lines in the universal projection shape;
`releaseResources(tx, tenantId, ref)` frees what the work unit held, in the
settlement transaction, so "bill settled" and "resources released" cannot be
observed apart. The work-unit ref is a tagged union — `TABLE_SESSION` has a
persisted work unit, `IMMEDIATE` deliberately has none (the priced cart IS
the work unit; plan §3.3 rejected inventing an order row for retail) — so
both shapes are first-class rather than one pretending to be the other.

**Implementations.** `TableServiceFulfilmentProvider` collects via an
INDEPENDENT query over the same rows the bill's subtotal was computed from —
so the D58 sum invariant now compares two reads, not one restated — and owns
the table-release logic that lived inline in `closeSession` (physical →
AVAILABLE; open table → dissolve, D49/D50). `ImmediateFulfilmentProvider` is
honestly thin: pass-through collection, nothing to release; it exists because
`FulfilmentProviderFactory` holds a total `Record<FulfilmentKind, …>` with no
fallback (the D56 rule), so a kind without a provider is a compile error.

**Consumers.** Both table-service close paths (dine-in, takeaway) resolve the
concrete provider — not the factory; the service IS the table-service
lifecycle and re-reading the profile per close to learn what the file already
is would be ceremony. The factory serves kind-agnostic callers (Phase 5's
reporting, future settlement surfaces). The provider-contract importer sets
gained the two modules under this record.

### D62 — Catalogue REST surface: `/products` is canonical, `/products/sellable` is the POS read model

Implements Phase 5 of the convergence plan (§9). Paths that were already
correct stay; concepts that were never restaurant-specific leave
`/restaurant`; every alias says so in-band and dies on a schedule.

**`GET /products/sellable`** — the one POS read model, for every domain.
SHARED CORE like `/products` itself: which BLOCKS the response carries is
decided by the tenant's capabilities, not a module key — a retail tenant
gets NO `modifierGroups` key (absent, not `[]`: §9.5's rule that absent
means "does not have this concept"). Money is decimal STRINGS. Price
resolution happens server-side, once — base → collection override → channel
override — and `priceSource` says which rule won. Keyset pagination
(`cursor`/`limit` capped at 200). `stockState` includes `UNTRACKED` as a
real state distinct from `OUT`. The legacy `/restaurant/pos-catalogue`
became a thin adapter over the same service preserving its number-typed
contract, wearing `Deprecation`/`Sunset`/`Link successor-version` headers.

**Modifier groups moved home.** `/products/modifier-groups` is canonical —
"cut to 3 keys +$6" and "add bacon +$2" are the same feature — with the
`/restaurant/modifier-groups` alias deprecated in place. One service serves
both.

**Collections** — `/branches/:id/collections`, `/collections/:id/sections`,
`/sections/:id/entries` — are the successor authoring surface the D60 410s
point at: `Menu`/`MenuSection` under their real job description, holding
`CatalogueEntry` placements of PRODUCTS. `priceOverride` is the only price a
placement may own; entry deletion is archive (D42/D43 heritage). Gated on
MENU_MANAGEMENT like the surface they replace; retail gains the module when
Phase 9 flips `catalogue.collections` on — routes ready first.

**Reports re-backed.** Five of the six restaurant reports now read the
settlement document (`Sale`/`SaleItem`) — the same source retail reporting
reads — with waiter performance attributed by `servedByUserId` (D58/Q6) and
channels by `Sale.channel`. Voids stay operational (an order-lifecycle fact
with no sale-level analogue). One recorded semantic shift: financial figures
now measure SETTLED documents rather than ordered-but-possibly-unsettled
items — the old numbers could count food later voided at the table.

**Deprecation policy** (plan §9.1): aliased routes keep working, carry
`Deprecation: true`, `Sunset`, and a `Link rel="successor-version"`, and are
removed no earlier than two releases after the successor — each removal its
own decision.

### D63 — External identity lives in `ExternalEntityRef`; the QuickBooks quarantine begins

Implements Phase 6 steps 1–4 of the convergence plan (§4.9, §8.10). Eight
Layer-1 models carry QuickBooks columns and ten domain-neutral modules read
them (plan defect D-9) — a coupling every future domain would inherit. The
PO's constraint (D68 in the plan's numbering): QuickBooks serves the hardware
template only.

**Step 1 — the satellite.** `ExternalEntityRef` generalises the barely-used
`QuickBooksMapping` by a `provider` column: one home for
`(tenant, provider, entityType, localId) → external identity + sync state`.
Its only FK is the tenant — it can never cascade into a core row, and a ref
outliving its entity is a reconciliation signal, not corruption.

**Step 2 — dual-write, live.** Every write of vendor identity or sync state
(the four QBO sync services, the sync queue's PENDING resets, the retail
`markSynced` path, product import commit, supplier map/unmap, customer
queueing, product PENDING marks) now mirrors into the satellite in the same
transaction via one helper (`mirrorExternalRef`). Column defaults need no
mirror: reconciliation reads absence as agreeing with `NOT_SYNCED`/no-id.

**Steps 3–4 — backfill + reconciliation, proven.**
`backfill-external-entity-refs.ts` (copy, never move; dry-run/write/
idempotent; includes the `QuickBooksMapping` rows) and READ-ONLY
`reconcile-external-entity-refs.ts` (exit 0 only on zero mismatches). Run
locally: 1,557 refs copied, reconciliation clean; a deliberately staged
pre-instrumentation drift was caught by the reconciler (named the sale and
both values) and trued up by re-running the backfill — the exact operational
loop production will use.

**The read switch (step 5) is NOT in this change, by the plan's own design**:
it deploys only after the reconciler reports clean across a full PRODUCTION
sync cycle (risk R10 — the only paying integration). The code change is then
mechanical: the ten readers move to the satellite, the tripwire's ratchet
list goes to `[]`, and step 6 gates `syncStatus` out of the public DTOs.

**The ratchet.** `quickbooks-isolation.spec.ts` pins the EXACT current
vendor-column reader set outside the integration modules — it may only
shrink; file eleven fails by name — and pins the satellite + mirror to the
integration and the instrumented legacy write sites, so `ExternalEntityRef`
cannot grow the disease the columns had.

No QuickBooks behaviour a hardware tenant can observe changes in this phase;
if one can tell it happened, it is wrong (plan non-goal).

### D64 — `Product.attributes`: domain catalogue fields without a migration per domain

Implements Phase 7 of the convergence plan (§4.6). The rule that decides
where a product field lives, now enforced end to end:

> **Behaviour goes in columns. Description goes in `attributes`.** If the
> engine must branch on it — inventory, pricing, tax, settlement — it is a
> typed column and a migration with a decision record. If only the domain UI
> and reports read it, it is a validated key in `Product.attributes`.

**Storage.** `attributes JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}'` + GIN index
(migration `20260826000000`, self-backfilling — every existing row is the
valid empty document). Values are scalars only; a key that wants structure
is a key that wants promotion to a column.

**One declarative schema, three consumers.** Each `DomainDescriptor` now
REQUIRES `catalogue.attributeSchema` — a descriptor must say "no
attributes" rather than get it by omission. The same list drives:

1. `GET /products/attribute-schema` — what the tenant's wizard renders;
2. the server-side validator (`validateAttributes` in `@hardware-pos/shared`,
   applied by `ProductAttributesService` on create and update) — refusals
   are `400 PRODUCT_ATTRIBUTES_INVALID` with per-key issues;
3. the sellable listing's `attr[key]=value` filters — keys checked against
   the schema, values coerced to the field's type, unknown key or
   uncoercible value a 400 naming itself, never a silently-empty page.

So a new vertical's catalogue fields are one descriptor edit: no migration,
no DTO change, no wizard code — the generic attributes step renders any
schema, and only appears when the schema is non-empty.

**Declared today.** HOTEL carries the plan's worked example (bedCount,
maxOccupancy, viewType) — all OPTIONAL for now, deliberately: the same
wizard authors a hotel's food, and a required `bedCount` would block every
burger. Requiredness arrives with STAY_UNIT authoring, hung off the
sellable kind. Hardware, food service and GENERAL declare `[]`, and an
empty schema is a CLOSED door: every `attributes` key is refused, which is
what keeps the column from growing schemaless sprawl.

**Semantics.** The document is replaced whole when provided (`undefined`
leaves it untouched); an optional key is cleared by omission, never by
`null`. `attr[…]` filters ride the restored Express `extended` query parser
(Express 5 dropped it; `main.ts` and the integration harness set it back)
so a nested `attr` object passes the whitelist pipe as one declared key.

**Found and fixed while wiring the route:** Phase 5's module edit had folded
`ProductModifiersController` into a `//` comment in `products.module.ts` —
its `GET/PUT /products/:productId/modifier-groups` routes 404ed live while
the route matrix stayed green, because the matrix reads decorator metadata
off controller CLASSES, which exist whether or not any module registers
them. The controller is re-registered (verified live), and the matrix spec
gained the missing tripwire: every controller class must appear, comment-
stripped, in some module's `controllers: […]` array — exact sets both ways,
with an inline mutation proof that replays the actual defect.

Attributes are deliberately absent from `SellableItem` (the POS grid does
not render them) and from every money/stock path — the D30 spec suite pins
the validator's whole refusal surface, including the empty-schema case.

### D65 — components, and rounds finally move stock

Implements Phase 8 of the convergence plan (§8.8), closing defect D-5:
`StockMovementReason.ORDER_ROUND` was declared and never written — a
food-service tenant's stock was purchase-side only. Open decision Q4 is
resolved as the plan recommended: **depletion happens at round SUBMIT**, in
the round's own transaction (the same reasoning as D53 — food reaching the
kitchen is the event that matters), **with a compensating movement on
void**.

**The model.** `ProductComponent` — what a COMPOSED_ITEM or BUNDLE consumes
per unit sold, ONE level, no recursion. Authored via
`GET/PUT /products/:productId/components` (replace-all, wizard card D,
audit-logged); writes are refused `403 COMPONENTS_NOT_ENABLED` for tenants
whose domain does not declare `capabilities.catalogue.components` — flipped
TRUE for food service (hotel inherits) in this change, false elsewhere.

**What depletes, by sellable kind.** STOCK_ITEM → itself, 1:1 (the bottled
drink in a restaurant, D-5's worked example). COMPOSED_ITEM / BUNDLE → its
recipe rows at `qty × quantity × (1 + wastageRate)`. SERVICE / TIME_SLOT /
STAY_UNIT → nothing. The oversell guard is the provider's own
(`reduceStock`): a round the shelf cannot support is refused WHOLE, exactly
as a retail cart is; the recourse is a stock adjustment.

**Deliberate deviation from the plan's "absent = 1:1" note.** A
COMPOSED_ITEM with NO recipe depletes NOTHING. Sticking to the plan text
would have broken every restaurant at deploy (every dish sits at quantity 0)
and contradicted D62, which already displays componentless COMPOSED items
UNTRACKED because their stock number is a number nothing maintains.
Authoring a recipe is the per-product opt-in that §12.3.5 pairs with an
opening stock-take; a packaged drink misclassified COMPOSED is fixed by
reclassifying it. To that end the D60 backfill's Stage A rule now ALSO runs
at authoring time (`deriveSellableKind` in ProductsService): Service →
SERVICE, foodType set → COMPOSED_ITEM, else STOCK_ITEM — re-derived on
update only when an input of the rule changes, so authored rows can no
longer drift from backfilled ones.

**The ledger.** One `StockMovement` per (order item × depleted product):
negative delta, `ORDER_ROUND`, `refType RESTAURANT_ORDER_ITEM`, `refId` the
item, `balanceAfter` read back in-transaction. A void mirrors the RECORDED
movements (`…_VOID`, positive delta) — never a re-expansion, so a recipe
edited between submit and void still restores exactly what was taken; the
presence of a compensation row makes the restore idempotent. Takeaway
depletes through the same engine. Tenants with DISABLED inventory are a
full no-op — no ledger noise. Per §12.3.5, NOTHING is backfilled: history
stays purchase-side; depletion starts at cutover, forward only.

Engine: `providers/inventory/round-depletion.service.ts`, writing only
through the caller's transaction like every provider. Verified live end to
end: deplete 50 → 47.8 (2 × 1.1 wastage), void restore → 50, double-void
inert, oversell refused naming the ingredient, ledger pair
`-2.200/47.800` then `+2.200/50.000`.

### D66 — collections for every domain, and channel-scoped assortments

Implements Phase 9, the last phase of the convergence plan. Two changes and
one supersession:

**The surface opens.** The D62 collections routes
(`/branches/:id/collections` and descendants) are reclassified SHARED_CORE
— the catalogue is shared core, the same doctrine as `/products` and
`/products/sellable`. This SUPERSEDES D62's forward note that retail would
"gain the MENU_MANAGEMENT module": handing retail that module would have
opened the LEGACY `/restaurant/menus…` routes to hardware tenants, changing
what D60's gate assertions mean. Instead, writes follow the D65 components
pattern — refused `403 COLLECTIONS_NOT_ENABLED` for tenants whose domain
does not declare `capabilities.catalogue.collections`, reads open. The
capability flips TRUE for retail ("Trade counter", "Seasonal" — the plan's
original motivation for renaming menus) and for food service (menus ARE
collections; the capability now says so). GENERAL keeps false as the living
negative control, and the legacy `/restaurant` menu reads keep their
MENU_MANAGEMENT gate untouched.

**Channel scope.** `Menu.channels OrderChannel[] @default([])` (migration
`20260828000000`, additive — the empty default means what every existing
row already meant: all channels). Create/update accept it; the collections
list filters by `?channel=`; and `/products/sellable` honours it — asking a
DINE_IN-only assortment for TAKEAWAY yields an empty page, not the
collection anyway.

**The menu admin dies.** `components/restaurant/menu/**` is deleted
(browser, item wizard, CRUD dialogs, `?view=legacy` escape hatch — every
editing control had answered 410 since D60, and a browser of dead buttons
is a broken UI, not a fallback). `/menu` stays as a pointer card so
bookmarks explain themselves. `ProductSelectorDialog` — a generic product
search, not a menu concept — moved to `components/products/`, where the
promotion editor and the D65 recipe card import it.

Verified live on the hardware tenant: create scoped collection → section →
priced entry → sellable serves it (`COLLECTION_OVERRIDE`, 111.50), wrong
channel serves zero, channel list filter includes/excludes correctly.

### D67 — auto-printing, and dine-in as a waiter flow  *(superseded by D68)*

> **Superseded 2026-08-20 by [D68](#d68--the-kitchen-board-replaces-the-kitchen-printer).**
> The dine-in half stands and is live. Everything about PRINTING below —
> the outbox, the two transports, the on-site agent, the printer routing —
> was withdrawn and deleted a day after it shipped. It is kept here as the
> reasoning D68 overturns, not as a description of the system.

PO requirements, 2026-08-18/20. Two things that turned out to be one change:
the dine-in POS mode assumed a guest paying at the counter, and nothing in
the system ever drove a printer.

**Dine-in belongs to the waiter.** `/pos → Dine In` opened the counter cart
whenever no session was named — "guest is at the counter, payment collected
now, no table", the opposite of table service. It now always opens the table
picker → order entry. That screen also stopped reading the FROZEN legacy
menu tables (D60) and now reads the same converged catalogue as the counter
POS, sending PRODUCT-sourced lines: on a migrated workspace the legacy tree
is nearly empty, so the waiter was picking from a menu that no longer
exists.

**Printing is an outbox, drained after commit.** Phase 6 already wrote
`KitchenTicket` + `KitchenPrintAttempt` rows inside the round transaction
and never drove them. Now: submitting a round kicks a dispatcher that
renders ESC/POS and sends it; closing a table queues the bill in the close
transaction and prints it after commit. D53 is preserved absolutely —
printing can delay paper, never fail or slow an order. A failing printer
retries three times, then the ticket goes FAILED and surfaces on the KDS
with its reprint button.

**Takeaway prints both at placement** (PO, 2026-08-20): the cashier takes
that order, so the bill belongs on paper with the ticket. No Sale exists
yet, so the job points at the RestaurantOrder and is priced by
`computeRestaurantTotals` — the SAME calculator the close uses (D52/D59), so
paper and the Sale written minutes later cannot disagree. Handover then
skips its own bill, so a takeaway yields exactly one.

**Routing is owner-configured, user-overridable.** The owner adds printers
once per workspace (network scan or by IP) and marks each KITCHEN or
CASHIER; every user then picks their own defaults from that list. KOT: user
→ station links → branch default. Bill: user → branch default. An unrouted
item used to be dropped silently; it now falls back to a sole active station
and is logged by name otherwise.

**Two transports, chosen automatically.** The web app is on Amplify and the
API on EC2, and neither can open a socket to a printer on a shop LAN — while
a browser cannot speak raw ESC/POS at all (no TCP; HTTPS→private-IP is
blocked by mixed content, CORS and Private Network Access; `window.print()`
reaches exactly one OS-installed printer per device, so it cannot serve a
kitchen AND a cashier printer). So: an on-site agent (`apps/print-agent`)
dials out, leases work, prints on the LAN, acks. A branch whose agent has
checked in within two minutes is served by it and the server-side dispatcher
leaves those rows alone; a branch without one is printed directly by the API
(on-prem/single-machine installs). Leases with a TTL arbitrate, making
delivery at-least-once: a duplicate ticket is recoverable, a missing one is
not.

The ESC/POS encoder is in-repo (~15 commands) rather than a dependency, and
every template is asserted as real bytes.

### D68 — the kitchen board replaces the kitchen printer

PO decision, 2026-08-20, superseding D67 one day after it shipped. The
kitchen does not want paper. It wants a screen.

**Kitchen tickets are not printed at all.** Every item a waiter confirms
onto an order appears on the kitchen board, and kitchen staff mark it done
when the food is up. This is a genuine simplification, not a downgrade: a
row written inside the round's transaction cannot fail to arrive, so the
retry ladder, the lease arbitration, the two transports, the ESC/POS
encoder, the LAN discovery and the on-site agent all had exactly one
justification and it is gone. All of it was deleted rather than parked —
1,900 lines and a whole app. Dead infrastructure attracts callers.

**Kitchen staff are a role.** Phase 6 gave `KOT_VIEW` to no template a
workspace seeds, so the board only ever opened for an owner — tolerable
while it was a monitor for a printer, indefensible now that it is the sole
delivery. The template holds exactly three permissions: read the profile
(without it the nav rail renders empty, not reduced), see the board, mark a
ticket done. Nothing on the floor, nothing with money in it. The pass is
the one place in a restaurant with no till accountability, and a role that
could both cook and settle a bill is how that becomes a problem.

**A ticket carries where the food is going.** Station, table, order, round,
waiter — what the printed KOT carried, for the same reason: a dish the pass
can see but cannot place does not leave the kitchen. `OUTSTANDING` is a
filter meaning "not COMPLETED" rather than "QUEUED", so a ticket left on one
of the retired print statuses by a pre-D68 round still reads as work to do
instead of silently vanishing from the board.

**The waiter completes the order; the cashier prints the bill.** Closing a
table is unchanged mechanically — it still raises the Sale — but it is
labelled for what the floor actually does, and nothing prints on the way
past. The cashier presses **Print bill** on the bill screen, which uses the
browser print path the retail POS has always used. That mechanism was never
the problem: a browser prints fine when a human presses a button, because
the print dialog is expected and the destination is that till's own
printer. What a browser cannot do is print unattended to two different
printers, which is the only thing the D67 machinery existed to solve.

Takeaway follows the same rule: the ticket goes to the board, the cashier
prints the bill.

**Schema.** Forward-only. D67's five migrations are already applied to live
development databases, and deleting them would force a reset that wipes
seeded workspaces; one drop migration costs a file and no data. The retired
`KitchenTicketStatus` print values stay in the enum — persisted data with
rows on it, and removing an enum value is destructive for nothing.

### D69 — dine-in is the ordinary POS screen, plus a table

PO decision, 2026-08-21. Dine-in had its own screen (`PosDineInWorkspace` →
`OrderEntry`), built before the counter POS existed and diverging from it
ever since: a different menu browser, a different cart, a different set of
affordances for the same act of composing an order. Waiters and cashiers
work the same shift; they should not be learning two POS screens.

**One screen.** `?mode=dine-in` now renders `PosCounterWorkspace`, exactly as
takeaway and delivery do. The menu grid, the cart, per-line edit/discount,
the portrait cart sheet and the modifier dialog are the same code, so they
cannot drift apart again. The POS fork is deleted;
`/tables/session/[id]` still mounts `OrderEntry`, because the floor plan's
own route is a different job.

**Plus a table.** The one structural difference table service has is that an
order belongs to a table, over a period, across rounds — so a session block
sits above the menu. Picking a table swaps it for a one-line strip rather
than navigating, so the menu never unmounts and a waiter mid-order does not
lose their place.

**One screen, two tails.** Composition is identical; the button diverges.
Counter modes go customer → payment → completion. Dine-in confirms a ROUND
onto the table and empties the cart, ready for whatever the guests ask for
next, which is the actual shape of table service. Then: close the session →
the bill is raised → the cashier settles and prints it.

Two things this exposed, both fixed here rather than filed:

- **The permission gate was wrong for the role the flow exists for.** The
  counter's Place Order is gated on `TAKEAWAY_CREATE`; the WAITER template
  deliberately holds `ORDER_SEND_TO_KITCHEN` and not that. Reusing the gate
  would have left the waiter looking at a permanently disabled button.
- **D68's Print bill could never have worked.** It called
  `/receipts/:saleId/customer`, which sits behind
  `@RequireModule(RETAIL_POS)` and answers 403 "Feature not available" to
  every food-service workspace, the owner included. The bill is now rendered
  client-side like the split bill beside it, which has always worked for the
  same reason. Verified against a live restaurant tenant: the endpoint 403s
  for owner and cashier alike.

Also fixed: the POS never recorded who seated the table. `waiterUserId` is
optional and the server does not default it to the caller, so the kitchen
board showed tickets with no name on them and the close path fell back to
whoever pressed the button.

### D70 — a waiter sees their own tables

PO decision, 2026-08-21. Waiter A must not see the sessions Waiter B is
serving: those are somebody else's responsibility, and a floor list that
mixes them is how a table gets served twice or not at all.

**Expressed as a permission, granted as the WIDER case.**
`TABLE_SESSION_VIEW_ALL` means "every open session on the branch, not only
your own". Owner and Admin hold it through the full catalogue; the
restaurant Cashier holds it because the till settles whichever table asks;
the hotel Receptionist holds it because the desk IS the whole floor's view.
The Waiter template does not.

The direction matters. A `_OWN` narrowing would make the permissive case the
default, so a role that forgot to mention it would see everything — the
failure that must not be reachable by omission. This way a forgetful role
sees less than it might, which is recoverable.

**Enforced on the server, at every route that reaches a session.** Hiding
the list would have been cosmetic: the session id is in a URL, and both
"order onto this table" and "close this table" are addressable by it. So the
list narrows in its WHERE clause — a waiter must not be able to read another
waiter's guest count out of a response the client then hides — and `get`,
`detail`, `createOrder` and `close` each refuse a session that is not
theirs.

**Refused as not-found, not forbidden.** A 403 on a specific id confirms
that the session exists and that somebody else has it, which is precisely
the fact being withheld.

**An unclaimed session is refused too.** `waiterUserId` is nullable — the
synthetic walk-in table behind counter and takeaway orders has no waiter —
and "nobody's" must not read as "everybody's". The POS records the waiter
when it seats a table, so a dine-in session always has one.

Frontend copy follows the rule rather than restating it: "Your open tables".

### D71 — the waiter holds the bill

PO decision, 2026-08-21. The waiter is the one talking to the guests, so the
waiter is the one who has to answer "what have we had", "what do we owe" and
"can we pay separately". All three lived at the till, on a screen a waiter
never opens — which meant the cashier reconstructing who ate what from a
conversation they were not part of.

**The full order, on the POS screen.** The cart shows what has not been sent
yet; the bill sheet shows everything that HAS, grouped by round, because that
is the order the guests ate in and the order they will remember when they
query a line.

**The server prices it.** `GET /table-sessions/:id/bill-preview` reads the
same rows the close will read and runs `computeRestaurantTotals` — the same
calculator (D52/D59) — so what a guest is shown at the table and what they
are charged a minute later cannot differ. The client never re-adds the lines.
A service charge the client does not know about is exactly the kind of
difference that turns into an argument at the table.

**Splitting moved to the waiter.** `BILL_SPLIT` joins the WAITER template.
`PAYMENT_COLLECT` deliberately does not: a waiter can divide a bill four ways
and still cannot settle any of the four. Verified live — the waiter's own
split-by-items succeeds and their attempt to collect a payment is refused.

**The split surface is shared, not copied.** `ItemSplitAssigner` was lifted
out of the bill screen (D51) so both the table and the till use the identical
control. A second copy would have been two split UIs with one set of money
rules between them, and they would have drifted the first time either was
touched.

**Why the split brackets the close.** Splits attach to a Sale and an open
session has none, so confirming does two things in order: close the session
(raising the Sale), then split it. These cannot be made atomic from a
browser, so the failure is designed rather than hoped away: if the split call
fails the close still stands, the waiter is told the table IS closed and that
the cashier can finish the division at the till. Reporting a plain failure
there would invite them to press it again against a session that no longer
exists — which is why the half-failure has its own test.

### D72 — the printed bill looks like a restaurant bill

PO decision, 2026-08-21, against a photographed reference bill. The layout is
now: centred logo, address, phone numbers, then Served By / date / bill
number / table, then a ruled DESCRIPTION / QTY / AMOUNT table, the tender,
and the totals block — Total Qty, Bill Amount, Paid Amount, Bal. Amount —
closing on the tenant's footer text.

**One template, two callers.** `renderThermalBill` prints the whole bill and
each split bill. They were two hand-written documents, which is how a tenant
ends up with a logo on one and not the other. A split's share IS its total:
the server has already apportioned the service charge into it, so the
template does not list bill-level charges again on a split.

**The header is the tenant's, and never the vendor's.** Everything above the
rule comes from the document profile (Settings → Documents), including the
logo, which was already uploadable and simply unused by the bill. The logo
REPLACES the company name rather than sitting above it: on the reference
bill the mark carries the wordmark, and printing both gives the guest the
brand twice. With no logo the name prints instead, so the header is never
anonymous. Nothing is substituted for an unset field (D54).

**Notes and discounts are on the paper.** A line's special instruction prints
indented beneath the line it belongs to — a guest querying a charge reads the
line they remember ordering, and a note is often the only thing separating
two identical lines. A discount prints as a DEDUCTION: shown as a positive
in a column of charges it reads as one more thing to pay. Zero rows are
omitted; a bill listing "Discount 0.00" is noise.

Three fields the bill needed and `BillView` did not carry: `taxAmount` (so a
taxed branch's bill can add up at all), `totalDiscount`, and the line's
`specialInstructions` — plus `servedByName`, `placeLabel` and `closedAt` for
the header. Served-by prefers `servedByUserId` over `cashierId`: the guest is
thinking of whoever brought the food, not the till operator.

**Two defects found while building it.** The escaper handled `&<>` only,
which is fine where every value lands in a text node but not here — the logo
URL goes inside `src="…"`, and a value containing a quote closes the
attribute. Found by a test feeding it `" onerror="alert(1)`. And the print
window fired `print()` on a 400 ms timer, which predates the bill having an
image at all; it now waits for every image to load or fail, with a 4 s
backstop so an unreachable logo cannot leave the dialog un-opened.

The retail receipt is deliberately untouched — it is the Tile Shop's
document, and D16 keeps its behaviour and wording as they are.

### D73 — a receipt wastes no paper between pages

PO report, 2026-08-21: the printed bill carried a page number and the word
"about:blank", and a long order came out looking like separate receipts.

**`@page { margin: 0 }` does both jobs.** It removes the browser's own print
header and footer — the page counter and the URL of the popup the bill is
written into — because with no page margin there is nowhere for that chrome
to be drawn, and CSS has no other lever over it. And it is what makes a long
bill read as ONE receipt: the gap between one page and the next IS the page
margin, and on a continuous roll that gap prints as a band of blank paper
mid-bill that looks like the receipt was cut and restarted. At zero, page two
carries on exactly where page one stopped.

**The page is deliberately NOT given a size — corrected the same day.** The
first attempt measured the document and wrote `size: 80mm <height>mm` so the
whole bill was a single page. Browsers honour an oversized page by SCALING it
onto the physical paper, so a long order printed correct and unreadably
small. The paper size belongs to the printer; the only thing this document
asserts is that it wastes none of it. The regression test names `size` so
the same fix cannot be reintroduced by someone solving "it splits across
pages" again.

Two smaller rules finish the job. Rows, the tender and the totals block carry
`break-inside: avoid`, so a line is never cut in half mid-row and the balance
is never stranded alone. And `thead { display: table-row-group }` stops the
column headings repeating at the top of every page — a browser repeats them
by design, which is right for a report and wrong on a roll, where a guest
reads the repeat as a second receipt starting.

Verified page by page in a real browser: a 60-line bill across three pages
prints the header once, continues flush from the top of page two with no
heading and no gap, and closes with an unsplit totals block. A short bill is
byte-for-byte what it was.

### D74 — the print popup drives itself

PO request, 2026-08-21. Pressing Print bill opens the print dialog with no
click on the page, and the popup closes once the browser is finished with it.

`afterprint` fires whether the operator printed or dismissed the dialog, and
no web API distinguishes the two, so both close the window: a cashier who
cancels wanted out of it either way, and the alternative is a dead receipt
tab left open behind the POS. The listener is attached BEFORE `print()`,
because `print()` is synchronous in some browsers and the event has already
fired by the time it returns.

**The dialog's own confirm button is not ours to remove.** Only Chrome's
`--kiosk-printing` launch flag makes `window.print()` go straight to the
default printer, and a page cannot set it. On a till launched with that flag
this is already the whole interaction.

The popup is also opened in the click's own turn now, before the document
profile is fetched. Browsers grant a gesture a few seconds of transient
activation, and `window.open` after an `await` gambles on that not having
lapsed — on a slow connection the popup is simply blocked and nothing appears
to happen. It opens with a placeholder and is filled in when the data lands;
`abort()` closes it if the data never does.

### D75 — the receipt ends where the text ends

PO reports, 2026-08-21, with photographs: a band of blank paper mid-receipt
between "Soup of the Day" and "Vegetable Fried Rice", and a large blank area
after the footer that had to be fed before the bill could be torn off.

Both are the same defect — the receipt was being paginated — and one
mechanism fixes both: ONE page, sized to the content. No boundary to leak a
gap, no remainder to feed.

**This is the second attempt, and the difference matters.** The first sized
the page and shrank long bills. `@page { size }` is a REQUEST: where it does
not match the paper the driver reports, Chrome scales the page to fit, and
432 mm of receipt on a 297 mm sheet is 69% — exactly the unreadable print
that came back. That is a printer-side setting (a roll or custom paper
length, and Scale at 100%), not something CSS can assert. So it is now
switchable per call: a workspace whose driver has a fixed page length turns
it off and pages normally at the correct size instead.

The height is measured rather than declared, because `size: 80mm auto` is
invalid CSS — the property takes one or two lengths — and because the real
height depends on how the document lays out. Measured after images settle: a
logo that has not decoded reports no height and would truncate the receipt to
the height of its text. Two millimetres are added so the cutter does not
shave the footer.

**`break-inside: avoid` was removed, having caused the first gap.** It was
there to stop a line being cut at a page boundary. On a continuous roll that
protection costs more than it buys: a row that does not fit is pushed WHOLE
onto the next page, and the space it vacated prints as blank paper mid-bill.
With the pages abutting, an allowed break rejoins invisibly and an avoided
one leaves a hole. `thead` is likewise demoted to a row group so the column
headings do not reprint mid-receipt, where a guest reads them as a second
bill starting.

### D76 — the column is the printable width, and the popup closes itself

PO report, 2026-08-21, on the D74/D75 delivery: the bill fitted one page but
printed SMALLER, and the popup stayed open.

**Why it printed smaller.** An 80 mm thermal roll has a printable width of
about 72 mm — 576 dots at 203 dpi, the rest under the mechanism. The page was
declared at 80 mm, so Chrome had a page it could not fit on the paper and did
what it always does with a mismatch: scaled it, by roughly the 90% the PO was
looking at. The fix is to stop asking for something the printer cannot give
— the column and the declared page are both 72 mm now, and a browser with
nothing to reconcile has no reason to scale.

Two supporting rules, each of which reintroduces the same defect on its own:
`box-sizing: border-box`, because with content-box the side padding is added
OUTSIDE the width and a 272 px column becomes a 296 px body on a 272 px page;
and one width for both media, because the page height is measured from the
on-screen layout and applied to the printed page, so a print column of a
different width prints short or long.

**Why the popup stayed open.** `afterprint` is the correct event and Chrome
does not reliably deliver it to a listener the OPENER registered on a
scripted popup. The close is now driven from the call site instead:
`window.print()` blocks until the dialog is dismissed, in every desktop
browser, so the line after it is the moment the browser is finished with the
document. The listener stays as a second path, guarded on `closed` so the two
cannot fight.

Verified: one 72 × 223 mm page, content filling the full width, ending 2 mm
after the footer.

### D77 — the receipt prints itself; the page size is the printer's

PO report, 2026-08-21, on the D76 delivery: both issues unchanged. Third
attempt at each, and this record supersedes the reasoning in D74–D76.

**The popup now closes itself, from inside.** Two assumptions were wrong.
`otherWindow.print()` does NOT block the caller — the dialog is modal to the
popup, not to the opener — so a `close()` on the next line ran while the
preview was still up, and Chrome ignores that. And `afterprint` is not
reliably delivered to a listener the OPENER registered on a scripted popup.
Both calls now live in a script inside the receipt document, where
`window.print()` blocks its own window and a script-opened window may always
close itself. Verified in a real browser: the popup closes on its own.

**The page size goes back to the printer.** Sizing the page to the content is
what a roll wants — no boundary to leak a gap, no remainder to feed — and it
cost correct print twice, at 432 mm and again at 223 mm. `@page { size }` is
a REQUEST: where the declared height exceeds the paper the driver reports,
Chrome scales the page down to fit, and the height of a receipt is by nature
whatever the order came to. There is no height that is safe on a fixed-length
page. So the fitting is opt-in, for a driver configured with a continuous
roll, and correct size wins by default.

**The column is 80 mm again.** D76 narrowed it to 72 mm — an 80 mm roll's
printable area — on the theory that the mismatch was causing the scaling. It
was not, and the receipt simply printed as a narrower column, which reads as
"smaller" too. The printer this ships against prints the full width.

What survives from D73–D76 and is confirmed working: `@page { margin: 0 }`
(no browser header or footer, and no gap between pages), no
`break-inside: avoid` (which was itself the photographed gap), and headings
printed once rather than per page.

Still outstanding, and it is a printer setting rather than a defect: paper is
fed to the end of the last page. Set the driver to a continuous/roll length
and the opt-in fitting removes it.

### D78 — printed from an iframe, at the printable width

PO report, 2026-08-21, with a photograph: at 80 mm the AMOUNT column bled off
the edge ("LKR 1,450.00" printed as "LKR 1,450.0"), the popup still would not
close, and with the driver now set to continuous paper the receipt still
broke across two pages.

**No popup.** Three rounds were spent trying to make one close itself — from
the opener (Chrome ignores `close()` while the preview is up, and does not
deliver `afterprint` to a listener the opener registered) and then from a
script inside the document. The receipt now prints from a hidden IFRAME, so
there is no window to close. The dialog opens over the app and dismissing it
leaves the operator where they were. Cleanup is a detached DOM node: were it
ever delayed, nobody would see anything, which is the opposite failure mode
to a receipt window left standing open. It also takes the popup blocker out
of the picture, so the document profile can be fetched first without racing
a user gesture.

The frame is positioned off-screen at the receipt's true width rather than
sized 0×0 — a zero-width frame lays out at zero width, wraps every line, and
would report a height with no relation to the printed bill.

**72 mm, left-aligned.** About 8 mm of an 80 mm roll sits under the mechanism
(576 printable dots at 203 dpi), so a column set to the paper width bleeds.
This is not the question the scaling turned on — that was the page HEIGHT
(D77) — and guessing it both ways cost a round each. Left-aligned because
centring a 72 mm column inside whatever page the driver reports puts 4 mm of
slack on each side and pushes the right-hand column past the last printable
dot: the same bleed by another route.

**One page, now that the driver can honour it.** With continuous paper set,
the measured `@page { size }` is no longer a request the printer has to
refuse, so the fitting is back on for receipts: one page, no boundary to leak
a gap, no remainder to feed.

### D79 — no window at all, and the width comes from the driver

PO report, 2026-08-21, with the driver dialog attached — which answered in
one screenshot what three rounds of guessing had not.

**Xprinter XP-365B, stock "USER": Maximum Size 78.7 × 101.6 mm, exposed liner
0.0 mm, margins 4 mm top and bottom.** Every symptom follows from those
numbers:

- 80 mm bled off the right, because the stock is 78.7 mm wide.
- 72 mm left a band of white down both sides, because the shorter page was
  centred on 78.7 mm of paper.
- The receipt split, because a 101.6 mm maximum length cannot hold a bill of
  any size — and the 4 mm top and bottom margins were the gap between the
  pieces.

The PO fixed the last one at the printer, which is where it belonged: a
longer Maximum Length. The width is this file's to get right, and it is now
78 mm, edge to edge — the page IS the printable area, so there is no column,
no centring and no padding.

**The print window is gone, not fixed.** Four reports of a receipt window
that would not close, chased from the opener and then from a script inside
the popup. Receipts now print from a hidden IFRAME: there is no window to
close, the dialog opens over the app, and dismissing it leaves the operator
where they were. `openPrintWindow` survives as a name and delegates — every
popup-based path had the same defect, and fixing them one at a time would
have left the next one to rediscover it.

The regression to guard is therefore not "does the window close" but "was one
opened at all", and the spec asserts exactly that: `window.open` is stubbed to
fail if anything in the module calls it.

The page size stays off for retail receipts, which print to whatever sheet
the till is set up with (D16). Only the thermal bill asks to be sized to its
content, and that only works because the driver's Maximum Length now allows
it.

### D80 — the page is the stock; the text is inset from the right

PO photograph, 2026-08-21: the bleed returned and worse — "LKR 1,450.00"
printed as "LKR 1,450.", "AMOUNT" as "AMOU".

D79 read the driver's stock width (78.7 mm) as the printable width and set
the text edge to edge on a 78 mm page. It is not: it is the width of the
PAPER, and the head stops short of it. Two characters at this font size is
about 3.5 mm.

These are two numbers, and every round that went wrong conflated them:

- The PAGE matches the driver's stock, so nothing is centred and no width is
  lost before the content starts. Getting this wrong at 72 mm is what left a
  band of white down both margins.
- The TEXT is inset 6 mm from the RIGHT, where the head stops. Getting this
  wrong at 0 mm is the bleed, twice; 4 mm cleared the clip but left the
  amounts hard against the edge, so it was raised the same day.

Left alone at 0: that edge has printed cleanly throughout, and insetting both
sides is the white the PO rejected. The inset is a single named constant
which the stylesheet interpolates, so the two cannot drift — and it is the
only number to change for a printer that clips a different amount.

Verified by rendering at the page width and measuring: the furthest ink lands
at 280 px of a 295 px page, exactly on the content edge, with nothing
overflowing.

### D81 — a storage failure names the bucket, the place, and the way out

PO report, 2026-08-21: uploading a business logo on a local Windows machine
failed with "The specified bucket does not exist".

Nothing was wrong with the code. `apps/api/.env` had been copied from a
machine configured for S3 (`STORAGE_PROVIDER=s3`, LocalStack at
127.0.0.1:4566), and that endpoint does not exist on a laptop. The default
has always been local disk; the environment overrode it.

What IS wrong is the message. It names neither the bucket, nor where the
bucket was looked for, nor the fact that this deployment is pointed at S3 at
all — and the fix is one line in a file the operator already has open. So the
S3 provider now explains its own failures: which bucket, which endpoint (or
region, on real AWS), and `STORAGE_PROVIDER=local` as the way out. Rejected
credentials and a refused connection get their own wording, because sending
someone to hunt for a missing bucket when the key is wrong wastes the same
hour again.

Raised as a 500, not a 400. The upload was valid and the SERVER is
misconfigured; a 400 sends the operator off to blame their image file. An
unsupported image type stays a 400 — that one really is the caller's.

### D82 — the LocalStack bucket creates itself

Follow-up to D81, 2026-08-21: the PO's LocalStack WAS running from
docker-compose, and the upload still failed with "The specified bucket does
not exist".

Both facts are true at once. A reachable LocalStack that returns
`NoSuchBucket` is not a connection problem — the community image does not
persist objects across container re-creation (that is a Pro feature), so it
starts empty every time and a bucket made by hand disappears with the next
rebuild. The compose file said so in a comment, which is the wrong place for
a step that has to happen every time.

The bucket is now created by an init hook in
`docker/localstack/ready.d`, which LocalStack runs once the S3 service
reports ready. Idempotent, so an existing bucket is a no-op rather than an
error.

Verified against a real container, not by reading the docs: first start logs
`HeadBucket => 404` then `CreateBucket => 200`; a restart shows the image
losing the bucket and making it again — which is the papercut this removes —
and running the script twice inside one container reports "already exists"
and exits 0.

### D83 — the bill where the work is, and the order behind a ticket

PO requests, 2026-08-21.

**The finalised bill is a dialog, not a link.** Closing a table used to offer
"View bill" pointing at `/bills/:id`. A waiter is standing at the table with
guests asking what they owe; sending them to another screen mid-service is
the wrong answer. The bill now opens in place the moment the table closes —
lines, totals, splits, and a Print button — and the strip re-opens it, so
dismissing it is not a one-way door.

**The Orders queue can open and reprint a bill.** That button existed,
disabled, labelled "Bill navigation lands in a follow-up slice": the queue
row carried a payment status but not the id of the sale it belonged to. The
projection already resolves the sale to read its total, so the id was there
all along — it is now exposed and the same dialog opens over the queue. A
third-party row has no sale of ours and gets no button at all, rather than a
greyed-out one that invites people to keep trying it.

**A kitchen ticket can show its whole order.** A card lists only what THIS
station is making, which is right for cooking and wrong for timing: the grill
cannot tell whether it is plating alone or alongside a curry the main kitchen
has not started. Details opens every item on the order, grouped by round and
labelled with the station that received it — read back from the tickets
rather than re-derived from the routing links, because a link can be edited
after the fact and the ticket is what the kitchen actually got.

KOT_VIEW, like the board, and deliberately NOT routed through the
table-session read: that one is scoped to the waiter who owns the table
(D70), and the kitchen owns no tables.

### D84 — the service charge has somewhere to be set

PO request, 2026-08-21: the service charge should appear on dine-in bills and
be configurable by the owner.

Half of it already worked. `computeRestaurantTotals` has applied the charge
since D52 and the bill template has printed it since D72 — but nothing in the
app could set the number, so it sat at the schema default of 0.00 and every
bill quite correctly showed no service charge.

Settings gains a Charges tab: the percentage, which channels levy it, whether
tax applies on top of it, and the flat packaging charge for takeaway. Per
BRANCH, because that is where the row lives and a group prices its rooms
differently. The channel toggles are explicit rather than assumed — "10% on
dine-in only" and "10% on everything" are both ordinary, and guessing puts
money on a bill that should not carry it.

Its own save button, outside the page's sticky bar: that bar writes the
document profile, and the charges live on a different row with its own
optimistic-concurrency version. One button writing two unrelated records is
how a stale version silently clobbers an edit.

Verified end to end against a live tenant: owner sets 10% → a dine-in preview
reads 6400.00 + 640.00 = 7040.00 → the closed bill agrees, and the Orders
queue row carries the sale id that opens it.

### D85 — a modal never grows past the screen

PO request, 2026-08-21: no popup may bleed off the viewport; 80% of the
height is the ceiling, and content beyond that scrolls.

`Dialog` had no cap at all. It grew with its content and ran off BOTH ends of
the screen — and the FOOTER went with it, so the confirm button on a long
bill or a long split list sat below the fold with no way to reach it and no
scrollbar to find it. The content was never the casualty; the actions were.

Three rules, and any one of them alone leaves the bug intact: the card is
capped and lays out as a column; the BODY is the scroller — `min-h-0`
included, without which a flex child's min-height is its content and the card
grows past the cap instead of overflowing inside it; and header and footer
are `shrink-0`, so the body is the only thing that gives.

`dvh`, not `vh`: on a phone or an iPad in Safari the toolbar collapses and
expands, and `vh` measures the tallest state — exactly the state where the
dialog does not fit.

The ceiling is now the same everywhere rather than per-control. `Sheet`
already capped itself but at 85dvh, with `height='full'` claiming the
viewport minus a 3rem strip; the retail cart panel took 88dvh. All three are
80dvh. `Drawer` is left alone — a side panel is full-height by design and
already scrolls its body.

Measured in a real browser at 1194×834, 834×1194 and 390×844: the card is
exactly 80.0% of the viewport at each, sits fully on screen, the confirm
button is reachable, and the body scrolls. Mutation-proven four ways —
removing the cap, dropping `min-h-0`, moving the scroll to the card, and
letting the footer shrink each fail.

### D86 — the logo has to be an absolute URL

PO report, 2026-08-21: a logo uploaded in Settings → Branding did not appear
on the printed receipt.

An uploaded asset is stored as `/uploads/<key>`, and `/uploads` is served by
the API — a different origin from the web app in every deployment (:4000 vs
:3000 locally, api.axlopos.com vs the Amplify host in production). Printed
raw, the browser resolves it against the app's own origin, finds nothing, and
the receipt comes out with the logo silently missing: no error, no
broken-image icon on paper, just no brand. `resolveImageUrl` is what the
product screens have always used for exactly this, and the bill template now
uses it too.

Also removed: the "Total Qty" row above the subtotal (PO). The reference bill
carried one; a guest counts plates, not units, and it is the only figure on
the receipt that is neither money nor a line they ordered.

**Not a defect — the service charge.** Reported in the same message as
missing from the bill. It is captured at CLOSE time onto the Sale, which is
correct: a bill is a settled document, and changing a rate afterwards must
not rewrite what a guest already paid. The database says so plainly — the
rate was set at 12:31; S-000007, closed at 12:32, carries 640.00, and every
sale closed before it carries 0.00 and always will. A rate set today applies
to tables closed after it, not to bills already raised.

### D87 — the till prints, the waiter serves, and every page has a floor

PO, 2026-08-21, four things in two messages.

**Two names on the bill.** "Served By" is the waiter — the person the guest
actually spoke to — and a new **Cashier** line under it names whoever pressed
Print. They are different people and the receipt now says so, which is what
makes a printed bill answerable: a guest querying the food knows who served
them, and a manager querying the money knows who took it. The waiter comes
from the session; the cashier is read from the printing user's own session at
print time, not stored on the Sale — reprint it tomorrow from a different till
and the line correctly names whoever reprinted it.

**Only the till prints.** Print is gated on `PAYMENT_COLLECT`, which the
waiter template does not carry and the cashier and owner do. The waiter still
sees the whole bill, still splits it, still closes the table — they just have
no Print button and no "Open billing" link, because handing a printed bill to
a guest is a payment act and the waiter does not take payment.

This is the frontend half of a rule the server already enforced (D31: hiding
is usability, the server is the authority). `POST /v1/restaurant/billing/…`
still refuses a waiter's token, and that refusal, not the missing button, is
what protects the till.

**Bottom padding — and a Tailwind trap worth recording.** Almost every
restaurant screen ran its last row flush against the bottom of the scroll
container. The app shell had `p-4 pb-safe md:p-6`; `pb-safe` sets
`padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` — which is **0 on every device
without a notch**, and because it comes after `p-4` it *replaces* the 16px
rather than adding to it. The screens with no bottom padding had it deleted by
the class meant to protect it.

My first fix was `pb-safe-8 md:pb-safe-12`, and it was wrong in a way that
looked right in the markup: **Tailwind generates no variants for a custom
class**, so `md:pb-safe-12` compiled to nothing at all. The shell now uses a
single `.pb-page` that carries its own media query — `calc(2rem + env(...))`
below 48rem, `calc(3rem + ...)` above. Measured in a real browser: 32px at
390×844 and 48px at 1194×834, where it used to be 0.

`TAB-PAD-001` reads the computed padding off the real scroll container rather
than asserting a class name, so it fails on the `md:` trap, on a reverted
`pb-safe`, and on a future shell that pads the wrong element.

**The waiter's POS shows Dine In and Takeaway.** A waiter has no reason to
raise a Delivery order — that is a counter and third-party channel — but a
seated guest asking for something to take home is ordinary, so takeaway stays.
The waiter and restaurant-cashier templates gained `TAKEAWAY_CREATE`
(`TAKEAWAY_VIEW` too, for the waiter), and the order-type modal takes an
explicit `modes` list instead of hard-coding all three. When only one mode is
available the modal does not appear at all and the mode chip is hidden — a
choice of one is not a choice.

**Honest limit.** Mode filtering here is presentation. `PosOrderTypeModal`
offers what the permissions allow; the server is what refuses a delivery
order from a waiter's token, and it still does. Anyone reading the modes list
as a security boundary would be reading it wrong.

**Requires a reseed.** The two template grants only reach existing users
through `pnpm db:seed`; roles already in the database keep the permissions
they were created with.


### D88 — a reload must not change who you are

Found while verifying D87 in a browser, not by a test: the waiter's order-type
chooser rendered with **no options at all**.

`loadSession()` overwrote the stored permission set with
`permissionsForRole(user.role)` on every read — the enum role, not the role
row. For a user whose authority is a custom role that is simply the wrong set:
the waiter's enum is CASHIER, so a page reload silently turned them into a
retail cashier. `toSession` had already been fixed to keep what the server
resolved at login; the store threw it away again on the next load, which is
why the bug only ever appeared **after a refresh** and never during a session.

What a waiter lost on F5: dine-in (`ORDER_SEND_TO_KITCHEN`), takeaway,
bill splitting, opening a table. What they gained: `SALE_READ` — a Sales entry
in the rail that the API refuses. The fix trusts the stored set and falls back
to the enum only when there is nothing stored, which is the one case the
original comment was actually about.

**The gap it was hiding.** With the fallback gone, the restaurant cashier's
navigation went blank and `/pos` fell back to the retail checkout: the
`RESTAURANT_CASHIER` template never held `PLATFORM_PROFILE_READ`. It worked
because the retail CASHIER enum carries that permission and every reload was
handing it over. The template now holds it in its own right.

This is the failure mode D30 exists for: two wrongs that cancelled, and no
test could see either. The tripwire is a real jsdom round-trip through
`saveSession`/`loadSession` asserting the stored set survives (positive) and
that `SALE_READ` does not appear (negative), with three inline mutation
proofs — unconditional re-derivation, merging both sets, and an inverted
guard. Restoring the original line fails two of them.


### D89 — the rail's footer note earns its space or leaves

PO, 2026-08-21: remove "Sales and catalogue are managed in AxloPOS." from the
sidebar.

The QuickBooks note exists to answer a real question — *where do my books
live?* — and its answer is somewhere else. The AxloPOS variant answered the
same question with the name of the app the reader is already looking at, and
charged a divider and a block of rail for it. `NONE` now returns null, which
removes the note **and** the rule above it; the QuickBooks sentence is
untouched, verbatim, per D16.

The tripwire asserts both halves in one test — QuickBooks present, AxloPOS
absent, and no empty divider left behind. Split in two, deleting the entire
footer would leave the negative green and read as a pass. Mutation-proven both
ways: restoring the sentence fails it, and deleting the whole footer fails it.


### D90 — opening hours the owner sets, per weekday and per date

PO, 2026-08-21: the restaurant's opening and closing hours should be
configurable from Settings, per weekday *and* for individual dates — every
Monday 09:00–22:00 against an ordinary 07:00–23:00, and 13 August (a poya day)
on its own terms. The calendar's hours must follow.

**Two tables, because they answer two different questions.** A weekly rule is
what the restaurant normally does; an override is what it is doing on one
named date. Folding both into one table means either seven rows carrying a
nullable date or a date column that is sometimes a weekday, and the query that
resolves "what are today's hours" stops being obvious. Resolution is
override → weekday rule → fallback, first match wins, and the fallback is the
08:00–23:00 the calendar has always drawn, so a branch nobody has configured
renders exactly as it does today.

**Minutes since local midnight, stored as `Int`.** Not a `DateTime`: a
restaurant that opens at seven opens at seven, on the wall clock, in March and
in October. A timestamp would carry a date nobody means and a UTC offset that
moves under it. Not `"HH:MM"` text either — every comparison would parse a
string. `closesAt` may exceed 1440 to mean the small hours of the next day
(a kitchen closing at 01:00 is `1500`), which is why closing is stored as a
duration from the same midnight rather than a clock time: `01:00` and `25:00`
are the same wall clock and very different closing times.

**Per branch.** Hours are a property of a location — a group's city branch and
its beach branch keep different ones — and this is where `RestaurantBranchConfig`
already lives. Writes need `RESTAURANT_CONFIG_MANAGE` (the owner). Reads are
gated on `PLATFORM_PROFILE_READ`, which every food-service role now holds
(D88), because the calendar is a floor tool: the waiter reading the book needs
today's hours as much as the owner setting them.

**A closed day still draws its bookings.** If a date is marked closed but a
reservation exists on it, the calendar shows the reservation and says the
branch is closed. Hiding a booking because the hours say the door is shut
loses a guest who is going to turn up anyway; the widening rule that has
always kept a late booking on-chart is unchanged and now widens past the
configured window as well.

**One Save button per tab.** Adding a second self-saving tab exposed a bug in
the first: the sticky bar at the bottom of Settings saves the DOCUMENT
profile, and it is fixed to the viewport, so on Charges (D84) it sat on top of
the Save button that actually applied to what the operator had just edited.
Two Save buttons with the wrong one on top. The bar is now hidden on the tabs
that write their own record.

**Migration.** `20260904000000_add_branch_opening_hours` adds
`BranchOpeningHours` (unique per branch+weekday) and `BranchOpeningHoursOverride`
(unique per branch+date). Both cascade from branch and tenant. No existing row
is touched and no column is dropped, so a deploy that runs the migration
without the new UI behaves exactly as before.


### D91 — the picker shows the room, not just the empty seats

PO, 2026-08-21: the dine-in POS should show open tables too, with a filter for
them in the "which table" block.

The block listed only `AVAILABLE` tables. A seated one was simply **absent** —
so a waiter looking for the party on M4 saw a gap where M4 should be, with no
way to tell whether the table was taken, being cleaned, or had been deleted.
The only occupied tables anywhere on the screen were the waiter's own, in the
strip above, and a floor has more tables on it than that.

Every table in the area is drawn now, and a three-state filter — **All · Free ·
Open** — narrows the list rather than defining it. The default is All, because
the ask was to *see* open tables, not to go looking for a filter first.
"Open" means a session is running (`SEATED`, `OCCUPIED`, `BILLING`): those are
one party at one table from the floor's point of view, and asking a waiter to
know which of the three their table is in would be a filter that hides things
for reasons they cannot see.

**Shown is not the same as offered.** A tap does three different things now: it
seats a free table, resumes one of the waiter's own, and does nothing at all
for anyone else's — that one is drawn greyed, with its state named and a title
saying whose it is. This is D70 held to rather than worked around: the server
returns only sessions this user opened, so a table that is occupied and absent
from that list belongs to another waiter, and offering the tap would be
offering a refusal. A supervisor holding `TABLE_SESSION_VIEW_ALL` sees them all
as workable, which is the same rule, not an exception to it.

The state chips share ONE row with the area chips. A second row costs 44px of a
block that is capped at half the viewport, and the two read left to right:
which tables, then where.

**A stale cap, found while measuring.** That half-viewport rule was expressed
as `max-h-[calc(50vh-11rem)]` on the table grid — the 11rem being a fixed
reserve for the block's own chrome, measured once on a tablet. The new chips
wrap to a second row on a narrow screen, where the real chrome is **15.5rem**,
so the block would have quietly grown past half the screen on a phone. The
guess is gone: the CARD carries `max-h-[50dvh]` and the grid takes what is
left. The constraint is now exact at every width with nothing to keep in step.
Measured at 834×1194, 1194×834, 390×844 and a deliberately cramped 390×500 —
within half the viewport at each, with the grid scrolling and tables still
reachable at the smallest.

Mutation-proven three ways in the render spec (restoring the AVAILABLE-only
filter fails five tests; rendering the chips but ignoring them fails three;
making every table clickable regardless of ownership fails one), and once more
against the browser — `TAB-DINE-003` fails when the chips are ignored. One test
of mine was replaced during this work for promising an empty-state assertion
it never made.


### D92 — Open is a destination, not a second filter

PO, 2026-08-21, on the D91 picker: drop the All and Free chips and put Open in
the area strip, as if it were another area.

D91 had shipped two independent selections side by side — table state and
dining area — which is six combinations for a question with one answer:
*which tables am I looking at?* The strip now carries one selection: **Open**,
then each floor. Open first, because during service "carry on with a table" is
the commoner errand than "seat a new party", and a strip that scrolls should
not hide the commonest destination behind a swipe.

The partition falls out of it, and is better than what D91 had: an open table
lives under Open and nowhere else, a free one lives on its floor and nowhere
else. Every table on the branch is in exactly one place, so no selection can
hide one — which was D91's whole point, kept, with a third of the controls.
Open spans every floor, because a waiter carrying two tables in two rooms
should not have to remember which room to look in. A floor whose tables are
all seated says so and points at Open, rather than reading as a floor with no
tables in it.

What did not change: another waiter's table is still drawn and still dead
(D70 — the server returns only sessions this user opened), and "Your open
tables" still sits above everything, cross-floor and unfiltered.

### D92b — `__walk_in__` was never internal

Same message: change `__walk_in__` to "Walk In" everywhere.

A `DiningArea` row's `name` **is** its display name. The synthetic area that
takeaway orders hang their table from was called `__walk_in__`, so that string
appeared verbatim as a chip in the waiter's picker and on the floor plan. It
was only ever invisible on a branch that had never taken a takeaway order.

The rename moves the identity, though, and that needed care.
`@@unique([branchId, name])` means an owner who calls a floor "Walk In" would
collide with the synthetic row — a name nobody would type was doing real work
as an identifier, and a readable one cannot. `ensureWalkInTable` now looks the
row up by its reserved **position** (999; the delivery hub holds 998, and the
Tables screen numbers floors from 0), falling back to the name for a row the
migration could not rename. Reusing an operator's own floor is a strange home
for a synthetic table; failing every takeaway order on that branch is worse.

`20260905000000_rename_walk_in_area` is data-only and guarded with `NOT
EXISTS` for the same constraint: one branch with an existing "Walk In" would
otherwise abort the migration, and with it the deploy.

`__delivery__` is untouched — it was not what was asked, and it identifies the
same way. `hardcoded-audit.md` H6 moves from OPEN to PARTIAL rather than
closed, because half of it is still a magic string.

**Still open, and worth a decision:** the Walk In floor is now a
normal-looking chip in the waiter's dine-in picker, holding a WALK-IN table a
waiter can seat — which would open a dine-in session on takeaway plumbing. It
was equally seatable before, just uglier and easier to ignore. Hiding the
reserved floors (999/998) from the dine-in picker is a small change; it is not
this one.


### D93 — a rail entry is gated on what the screen can do

PO, 2026-08-25: "In restaurant POS, cashier should also be able to place takeaway
and delivery orders. That part is missing it seems."

It was not missing. It was unsigned.

The server has permitted the whole thing since D87: `POST /v1/restaurant/takeaway`
asks for `TAKEAWAY_CREATE`, the status change asks for the same, payment asks for
`PAYMENT_COLLECT`, and the till holds all three. The counter workspace computes
`[TAKEAWAY, THIRD_PARTY]` for exactly that permission set and renders the chooser.
The audit log shows the cashier had already placed and settled orders. What the
cashier did not have was any way to *find* the screen: the food-service `/pos`
rail entry hung on `SALE_CREATE` — a **retail** permission the restaurant till
deliberately does not hold (D87) — and so did the Ctrl+K command. The two doors
left were a dashboard tile labelled "Takeaway ready" and a "New sale" button on
the Sales page. Neither says "place an order here."

**`SALE_CREATE` was the wrong lever, and granting it would have been the wrong
fix.** The WAITER template says so out loud: it carries `SALE_CREATE` with a
comment explaining the grant exists *because the POS and Tables rail entries are
gated on it*. A retail-sale permission had become a proxy for "may use the
restaurant floor screens", and the proxy had started lying. Granting it to the
till would have made the sidebar right by making the permission model wronger,
needed a reseed to reach the existing row, and handed the till a standing
retail-sale, discount-approval and receipt-issuing grant that goes live the day
someone enables `RETAIL_POS` or gates a food-service route on it.

So the gate moved instead. `NavItemSpec.permission` now accepts an **array,
meaning any-of**, and `/pos` lists the capabilities the screen actually offers —
`ORDER_SEND_TO_KITCHEN` (Dine In), `TAKEAWAY_CREATE` (Takeaway, and Delivery with
`PAYMENT_COLLECT`), and `SALE_CREATE` kept so nobody who reaches POS today loses
it. The entry now appears exactly when there is something behind the door. No
permission was granted, no seed is required, no migration, no API change.

Widening the existing field rather than adding a sibling `anyPermission` is
deliberate: `bindGroups` copies spec fields by an explicit whitelist, so a new
field somebody forgets to copy yields an item with **no gate at all**. Widening
the existing one makes every consumer a compile error instead.

**The dangerous direction is fail-open.** An any-of gate written as all-of-nothing
puts Settings and QuickBooks in front of every role in the product, so an empty
gate array REFUSES rather than passes, and the tripwire that proves it calls the
real exported `holdsAnyOf` — the first draft of that proof compared two local
expressions and passed happily while the function under test fell open. No nav
spec carries an empty gate today, which is exactly why the branch had to be
reachable from a test at all.

**A deep link may now open a mode you cannot work.** Making POS visible to the
till turns `/pos?mode=dine-in` into an ordinary link to receive from a colleague,
and unclamped it opens a cashier into a dine-in workspace whose Confirm & send
the server refuses — a 403 three taps in, after they have composed an order. The
mode logic moved out of the component into `apps/web/src/lib/pos/pos-modes.ts`
as a pure resolver (D28/D31), where the clamp is one line and testable without
rendering a workspace. It was untestable in place, which is why the hole was
invisible.

**Deliberately not done.** `/tables` carries the identical `SALE_CREATE` gate and
the identical problem — the till settles tables it cannot see in its rail — but
the complaint was about takeaway and delivery, and widening a second destination
is a decision somebody should make on purpose. There is a negative assertion
holding that line so it cannot drift in unnoticed. The hotel RECEPTIONIST holds
none of the three and still gets no POS; the retail `/pos` entry is untouched and
still requires exactly `SALE_CREATE` (D16). The palette keeps its retail wording
"Start new sale", which reads oddly in a restaurant — noted here rather than
fixed by editing a string the Tile Shop depends on.

**What the review changed.** An adversarial pass over this change confirmed no
findings, but three of its refutations conceded something worth acting on, and
all three were the same species of defect this decision is about — an assertion
that looks like a guarantee and is not one.

* `resolveInitialPosMode` opened with "the mode a `?mode=` deep link may open",
  which reads as route-wide. It is not: `/pos?mode=third-party` carrying an
  `externalOrderId` returns the third-party **inspector** earlier in
  `pos/page.tsx`, before the counter workspace exists. That screen is a
  different feature gated server-side on `PLATFORM_PROFILE_READ` /
  `PLATFORM_PROFILE_MANAGE`, so routing it through this resolver would apply
  the wrong gate and would hide from a waiter an inspector they are authorised
  to read. The docstring now says what it guards.
* The palette had a **second, hand-copied** `holdsAnyOf` and a hand-typed copy
  of the three permissions. That is the shape D56 already caught once (seven
  inline copies of a businessType predicate, each drifted). It now imports the
  real helper and derives the gate from the nav specs as the union of both
  domains' `/pos` entries — fail-closed if the specs ever fail to load.
* Two of the mutation proofs in `nav.test.ts` compared **local expressions**.
  `Boolean(gate)` against a literal array is a compile-time constant: it could
  never fail whatever the shipped gate did. They assert against the exported
  `holdsAnyOf` now.

The palette gate had no test at all — the whole web suite was green with it
fully fail-open. It has one, and the first draft of THAT re-derived the gate
instead of importing it, so mutating the component left every assertion green;
the second draft asserted the constant but not that the command uses it, so
hardcoding the old permission back onto the entry also passed. Both were found
by running the mutation rather than by reading the test, which is the whole
argument for D30's rule that tripwires are mutation-proven and not merely
written.

**Still open:** whether the WAITER's `SALE_CREATE` grant is now vestigial. Its own
comment says it exists only for the rail gate this decision removes, and closing
a table needs `TABLE_CLOSE`, not `SALE_CREATE`. Removing it is a separate
security decision and needs a reseed.


### D94 — the till watches the board

PO, 2026-08-25: "Show the kitchen tab to the cashier as well."

`KOT_VIEW`, granted to `RESTAURANT_CASHIER`, and nothing else. The board's
"Mark done" control is gated on `KITCHEN_STATUS_UPDATE`
(`kitchen-board.tsx:51`), which the till does not hold, so this is a read-only
view of what the kitchen is doing — a cashier fielding "is table six's food
ready?" can answer it. Marking a ticket done stays with the people who cooked
it (D68), and the server refuses the update regardless of what the screen
shows.

Note this is a **grant**, not a gate change, and deliberately so. D93 moved the
POS rail entry off a borrowed permission because the till already held the
capability the screen offers; here the till held *no* kitchen capability at
all, so widening the `/kitchen` gate to some permission it happens to have
would have been exactly the `SALE_CREATE` proxy mistake D93 was written
against. The honest change is the one that says what it means: the cashier may
read the board.

It reaches existing users through `pnpm db:seed`.

**Proving a read-only board is harder than it looks.** "The till has no Mark
done button" is also what an empty board, a failed request and a broken
selector each produce — the first probe returned zero for kitchen staff too,
which would have shipped as evidence of nothing. `WS-408` asserts the contrast
on the same board: the till sees N Details buttons and zero Mark done, kitchen
staff see N Details and N Mark done. Mutation-proven — granting the till
`KITCHEN_STATUS_UPDATE` fails both the unit test and the e2e.


### D95 — the workspace page stops listing what a workspace does not have

PO, 2026-08-25: drop the "Not included" block from the workspace configuration
page, "across all of the templates", and remove the paragraph telling the reader
to contact support to change what a workspace includes — "since it's not
possible to change what a workspace includes."

Both are gone, for every business template **including the Tile Shop's**. That
half needs saying out loud because D16 protects retail wording: this is not a
restaurant change that leaked, it is the PO's instruction applied where they
said to apply it. The original block was defended on the grounds that "what am
I not getting" is the question an operator arrives with — but the answer was a
list of things nobody can act on, printed under an instruction that could not be
carried out. An inventory of the absent is only useful next to a way to acquire
it.

The support paragraph made a weaker claim than the PO's reason, which is worth
recording: it said the change was not *self-service*, implying support could do
it. The code comment above it is more honest — `QUICKBOOKS → LOCAL` has no
migration in either direction, so it is not that the change is gated, it is that
it does not exist. Nothing replaces the paragraph: a screen that says nothing
about an impossible action is better than one that hints at it.

**And the hyperlink became a tab.** "Workspace configuration" was a small link
in the Settings header, which is where things go to be missed. It is a tab now,
beside the others. The body moved to `components/settings/workspace-tab.tsx` and
`/settings/business` survives as a thin shell around the same component — it is
bookmarkable, it was the only inbound link until this change, and it still
renders when `GET /v1/settings` fails, which the tab cannot: the settings page
returns its error card before the tab strip exists.

The tests for the removed block were rewritten rather than deleted. The
exact-set assertion that used to span "Included" and "Not included" now pins
"Included" against the profile's own module list, which is a stronger claim than
the two `toContain`s it protects — deleting it was the tempting move and would
have left the positives with nothing behind them.

### D96 — Settings shows the document this workspace actually prints

PO, 2026-08-25: the Layout and Preview tabs should show "the details related to
the bill that will be printed, not quotations like in hardware pos", and the
signature, stamp "and the other branding details that are relevant to quotations
and invoices are not needed under the branding tab of restaurant POS either."

A restaurant owner opening Preview was shown a **quotation for Portland Cement
50kg, billed to Perera Constructions (Pvt) Ltd** — the server's sample catalogue
is a hardware one. Layout offered them margins, A4 paper size, an SKU column and
a signature area, not one of which can reach a thermal bill: `thermal-bill.ts`
reads exactly seven profile fields, its three columns are hard-coded, and a
continuous roll has no page to lay out. Those controls were not merely
irrelevant, they were settings that changed nothing.

**One resolver, not nine conditionals.** `resolveDocumentSettingsPresentation`
takes the tenant's capabilities and returns view flags; the tabs read flags and
decide nothing. This is the `product-presentation.ts` shape applied to a second
screen, for the same reason — the question reaches nine places, and the one
that is forgotten offers a restaurant a signature upload it can never use. A
contract test asserts the capability is named in exactly one file across the
whole web app, as an exact set rather than a count.

It routes on `capabilities.documents.proformaBill`, not on the business type.
That names the DOCUMENT rather than the service model, so a takeaway-only bakery
keeps its bill without seating anyone, and HOTEL — the value the seven
hand-written predicates D56 replaced had all independently forgotten — inherits
the right answer through the food-service capability set. The resolver takes
`TenantCapabilities | null` rather than a business type for a second reason too:
`domain-single-authority.test.ts` pins the exact set of files allowed to contain
`businessType === null`, and a resolver copying that idiom would have failed a
spec in a file nobody would think to open.

**The preview is the real bill.** Rendered client-side from `renderThermalBill`
— the same function the till prints from, fed the tab's UNSAVED settings, so an
operator sees the effect of a change before keeping it. A fifth server-side
preview type would have meant a second copy of a template whose printer
measurements were got wrong twice (D79, D80), and the API's preview spec
iterates a hard-coded list of four document types, so the new one would have
been silently uncovered — a textbook D30 vacuity.

**Layout gets a read-only summary.** After auditing every field the bill reads,
there is nothing on that tab a restaurant can configure. So it answers the
question an operator actually has — what comes out of the printer, and which tab
edits each line — instead of offering controls that do nothing.

**The consequence the PO may not have intended, and what was done about it.**
Hiding the branding controls does not stop a restaurant printing the document
that uses them: `/sales/[id]` offered "Print A4 bill" unconditionally, and
driven as the restaurant owner it produced a full A4 **INVOICE** with the SKU
column and an "Authorized signature / Checked by / Approved by / Customer
signature" block. Removing the controls while leaving the document would hand a
restaurant a signature block they can no longer populate or switch off, so the
A4 button is hidden for a food-service workspace by the same flag. The thermal
receipt button stays — that is their document. Usability only:
`/print/sales/[saleId]` is ungated and a typed URL still renders it, and the
server is unchanged.

**A defect this uncovered.** `Charges` (D84) and `Hours` (D90) were appended to
the tab list unconditionally, so a Tile Shop owner has been shown two tabs that
answer "Feature not available" — verified live before the fix. They edit
`RestaurantBranchConfig`, a row a retail tenant has none of. The same resolver
now decides, which is how they should have shipped.

Unresolved is its own state throughout: while the profile is loading every flag
is false and the Preview tab says it is checking, rather than flashing quotation
chrome at a restaurant and correcting itself.

**Known limit.** Hiding the signature and stamp rows also hides their Remove
buttons, and a save re-sends the whole document profile — so a food-service
tenant that had already uploaded a stamp keeps it stored, invisible and unused.
For the pilot tenant both are null. Clearing one would need Reset to defaults,
which discards the whole document profile; a targeted clear is not worth a
migration for an asset nothing prints.


### D97 — saving one setting must not decide another

PO, 2026-08-25: "I get error when trying to order takeaway from cashier console
saying 'takeaway is disabled on this branch'."

Nobody had disabled takeaway. **Setting the service charge did.**

`RestaurantBranchConfig` is created the first time anyone saves any branch
setting, and the Charges tab (D84) sends only charge fields. The create path
filled `takeawayEnabled` with `false`, and `TakeawayService.create` refuses when
a row exists and says false — so the row that D84 created to hold a 10% service
charge switched takeaway off, and every takeaway order after it failed. The
column defaulted to `false` in the schema too, so omitting it would not have
helped.

Reproduced exactly, from an empty table: `PUT …/config` with charge fields only
→ `takeawayEnabled: false` in the response nobody reads → `POST …/takeaway` →
`400 Takeaway is disabled on this branch`.

`dineInEnabled` was already `?? true` in the same object, two lines away. That
asymmetry is why dine-in never broke the same way and why nothing caught this.

**The deeper fault, which is the one worth fixing.** The enforcement refuses
only when a row EXISTS and says false, so a branch with no row has always taken
takeaway orders — while `get()` reported `takeawayEnabled: false` for that same
branch. The API described a restriction the server does not apply. Any screen
built on that answer would have disabled a working button. Both now say the same
thing: takeaway is on unless somebody turns it off.

So three changes, not one: the create path defaults to `true`, `CODE_DEFAULTS`
reports `true`, and the column defaults to `true` so no future writer can spring
the same trap. `20260906000000_takeaway_enabled_by_default` also flips existing
`false` rows — every one of them was written by this defect, because no UI
anywhere turns takeaway off and the only caller that ever sent the field
explicitly is a test. The flag still works: an explicit
`takeawayEnabled: false` is honoured, and there is a test holding that line so
the fix cannot quietly become a hard-coded `true`.

Mutation-proven three ways: restoring `?? false` fails the regression test,
hard-coding `true` fails the explicit-refusal test, and reverting `CODE_DEFAULTS`
fails the agreement test.

**Not done:** the Charges tab still has no toggle for either channel, so
`takeawayEnabled` is settable only through the API. That is now harmless rather
than dangerous — the default is the working state — but a branch that genuinely
wants takeaway off has no screen for it. Worth adding beside the charges when
somebody needs it.


### D98 — the counter receipt prints itself

PO, 2026-08-25: once a takeaway order is placed by the cashier, the ticket goes
to the kitchen and "receipt must be immediately printed without showing the
print window to the user".

**The kitchen half already worked.** `TakeawayService.create` calls
`generateTicketsForRound` inside the same transaction that writes the order, so
a ticket exists before the response returns. Confirmed rather than assumed:
the order placed while verifying this has a `QUEUED` ticket at the Grill
station.

**The receipt half did not exist at all.** The completion screen showed a
"Receipt ready" indicator, which was an indicator and nothing more — no receipt
was ever produced. It prints now, automatically, the moment payment succeeds.

It prints from the SALE, not from the cart. The server decides the totals — the
service charge, the tax and any rounding are applied when the sale is created —
and paper that disagrees with the money actually taken is worse than no paper.
So the flow fetches the bill it just created and renders that.

**Printing must not be able to fail the order.** By the time the receipt is
attempted, the food is on its way to the kitchen and the money is collected. A
printer out of paper is a reprint, not a rollback, so the failure is caught and
reported on the completion screen — "Receipt not printed — reprint from
Orders" — rather than thrown. The screen tells the truth either way instead of
claiming a receipt that never came out.

**No window, and one print.** Verified by counting: placing a real order from
the cashier's console produced exactly **one** `print()` call and **zero**
popup windows, with no click of any kind. The hidden-iframe path (D78) is what
makes that true.

**The print dialog itself is not ours to remove**, and D74 already recorded
why: only Chrome's `--kiosk-printing` launch flag sends `window.print()`
straight to the default printer, and a page cannot set it. On a till started
with that flag this is now the entire interaction — order placed, ticket in the
kitchen, receipt out of the printer, nothing clicked. Without it Chrome shows
its preview, which is a property of the browser rather than of this code.

**One map, not three.** The `BillView` → printable-HTML mapping existed twice,
byte-for-byte identical, in `bill-screen.tsx` and `bill-dialog.tsx`, and this
needed a third caller. It lives in `lib/restaurant/bill-print.ts` now and all
three use it. Both former copies did the fetch, the map and the print in one
function, so the part most worth testing — that every money row reaches the
paper — had no test in either. It has one now, asserting the whole object at
once: a field DROPPED from the map is the failure that matters, and a
field-by-field test only catches the fields somebody thought to list.
Mutation-proven by deleting the service charge and the packaging charge from
the map.

### D99 — the roll is measured, not assumed

Report, 2026-09-01: the bill prints correctly from Google Chrome and prints
with its **left edge cut off** from Microsoft Edge. Same till, same roll, same
Xprinter XP-365B.

**The mechanism.** `@page { size }` is a request about a page BOX. It says
nothing about where that box is PLACED on the paper, and the two Chromium
browsers do not place it the same way: Chrome laid the 78 mm box down at the
printable origin at 100%, and Edge re-fits and centres it against the driver's
78.7 mm stock, which splits the overflow between both edges. A layout whose
only slack is on the right survives one placement policy and not the other.

This is the mirror image of a failure already in this file. D79 recorded
*"72 mm left a band of white down both sides, because the shorter page was
centred on 78.7 mm of paper"*. The centring never went away; D80 simply stopped
noticing it, because at 78 mm there was nothing left over to centre — in
Chrome.

**The defect was not the value of the inset.** It was that all the slack was on
one side, and that the number lived in source, where nobody can measure it.
D73 through D80 is seven rounds of setting these numbers from a laptop and
posting the result to be photographed. An eighth constant is the same bet with
a different number.

#### What this supersedes in D80

1. *"Right only. The left edge has always printed cleanly from x=0"* — false
   in Edge. The text is inset on **both** sides now, by two independent
   numbers.
2. *"insetting both sides is the white the PO rejected"* — it is not. That
   white came from a PAGE narrower than the stock, centred on it. A page equal
   to the stock, with padding inside it, produces no white to centre. The two
   were conflated.
3. *"The inset is a single named constant which the stylesheet interpolates"* —
   replaced. The correct values are a property of a printer, a driver and a
   browser together, and are not knowable from source. They are per-workspace
   settings, defaulting to the XP-365B's 78 / 3 / 5.
4. The blanket ban on `max-width` — replaced by a narrower rule, below.

#### What D79 and D80 keep, restated

The two numbers are still different things and must not be conflated again.
The **page** matches the driver's stock, so nothing is ever centred and no
width is lost before the content starts — that is why the page width is still
what goes into `@page { size }`, never the content width. The **text** is inset
from where the head stops. Insets are in millimetres, never pixels: a pixel
inset stops being a fixed physical margin the moment a browser applies a scale
factor, which is the family this whole defect belongs to.

Also unchanged: no popup, printed from a hidden iframe, and `window.open`
asserted never to be called. `@page { margin: 0 }`, for the browser chrome and
for the gap between pages. No `break-inside: avoid`. Headings printed once. No
page size for retail receipts (D16). And the right inset stays the LARGER of
the two, because its clip is a measured property of the print head where the
left's is browser drift.

#### `max-width` on the body, and the one value it may take

The body is now capped at exactly the page width. When `@page { size }` is
honoured the cap does nothing. When a browser refuses the size and lays the
document out on A4 or Letter instead, it stops a monospace bill designed for
78 mm from spreading across 210 mm and landing past the last printable dot —
which is a total loss, not a clipped character.

It is safe at that value and at no other. `max-width` narrower than the page,
plus centring, IS the D79 band of white. So the margin stays `0` and never
`0 auto`, and both halves are asserted negatively.

#### The document carries its own geometry

`printReceipt` is handed an HTML string. The stylesheet inside it decides how
wide the text prints; the frame it is written into decides how wide it lays
out, and the page height written into `@page` is measured from that layout.
Two numbers, produced in two files, that must agree — and for seven rounds
they were kept agreeing by hand.

The numbers now travel in the document as `<meta>` and the frame reads them
back. There is no parameter for a call site to get wrong and no second
constant to fall behind. It is metadata ABOUT the document, not a page-size
declaration: the template still declares no `@page { size }` of its own, and
D77's third position on that is untouched. The two claims are asserted as a
pair so the distinction cannot erode into one.

**A correction worth writing down, because the obvious fix is wrong.** The
frame lays out at the PAGE width, not the content width. The body is
`border-box` at `width: 100%`, so a frame 295 px wide already gives a content
column of 295 px − 6 mm = 272 px — exactly what a 78 mm page with the same
padding prints. Narrowing the frame to the content width would subtract the
insets a second time, wrap more lines, and over-measure the page height. It
would look like a correction and be a regression, and it is invisible on a
78 mm roll.

#### Calibration is an operator action

Settings → Documents → Preview now carries **Paper width**, **Left inset**,
**Right inset**, a fit-to-content switch, and a **Print calibration strip**
button. The strip prints, in one page:

- a solid bar pulled out to the page's own edges by negative margins equal to
  the insets — the only element that is not inset, and the one that separates
  "the page is wider than the stock" from "the insets are too small". Without
  it those two faults look identical on paper, which is how D79 spent a round
  narrowing the page when the inset was the problem;
- a millimetre ruler across the text column, so the first and last legible
  numerals give both insets directly;
- edge markers, and the widest line a bill can print (`LKR 1,450,000.00` in the
  AMOUNT column) — the exact string D80 watched come out as `LKR 1,450.`;
- the three numbers in force, and **the browser that printed it**. That last
  one is not decoration: Chrome and Edge disagreeing is the entire defect, and
  two strips on a counter are otherwise indistinguishable. An unrecognised
  browser prints an em dash, never a guess (D54) — a strip labelled with the
  wrong browser would have the operator calibrate the wrong one and stop.

The strip's body rule is byte-identical to the bill's, from the same shared
function, and that identity is asserted. An instrument laid out differently
from the document it measures is worse than no instrument.

#### No migration

The four fields land in `TenantSettings.data`, which is `Json`. The service
merges its defaults UNDER a stored blob, and the web client's cache read
spreads `DEFAULT_DOCUMENT_PROFILE` under the cached value, so an existing
tenant and a till holding a stale `localStorage` profile both pick the geometry
up on the next read with no backfill. Asserted, rather than assumed.

#### D16 and D30

One existing behavioural assertion changed: `thermal-bill.test.ts`'s "fills the
roll, held off the RIGHT edge only", which is the claim this record reverses.
It changed because of this decision, not to accommodate a refactor.
`receipt-print.iframe.test.ts` — including `width:295px` and
`@page{size:78mm 267mm;margin:0}` — and `bill-print.test.ts` survive
**unedited**, which is the evidence that the default path is unchanged.

Mutation-proven tripwires added:

- `receipt-print.geometry.test.ts` — that the frame width, the stylesheet and
  the injected page all come from the document's own geometry. The fixture is
  58 / 2 / 4, sharing no digit with the defaults, and the proof is written
  inline: `mmToPx(78) === 295 && mmToPx(78) !== mmToPx(58)`, so a printer that
  re-hard-coded the old constant could not produce the asserted numbers. The
  companion case feeds a document with no geometry and asserts the unchanged
  fallback, so the pair cannot pass by always trusting or always ignoring.
- `thermal-bill-geometry.test.ts` — that `readBillGeometry` reads the document
  rather than answering from the defaults, proven with the same fixture.
- `document-presentation.test.ts` — `showBillCalibration` across all three
  surfaces, in that file's existing style.

Two other things the tests found while being written, both now fixed: a
half-written meta set was accepted because `Number(null)` is `0` and `0` is
finite, which would have silently reported insets of zero — the very layout
this record removes; and a second fallback for the page width was dead code,
unreachable given the bounds, so it was replaced by an assertion that the
bounds keep it unnecessary.

**Verified how:** the strip printed from both browsers on the till, and the
numbers it produced recorded here.


### D100 — the board reads like a kitchen screen, and a bump can be taken back

PO, 2026-09-03: the board's content was right and its ergonomics were not —
compared against mainstream KDS products, it read like an office web page.
Four changes, one record, because they are one statement: the kitchen board
is furniture in a kitchen, not a page in a browser.

**Age escalation.** The big timer sits where the status badge sat — on the
outstanding tab every badge read "To make", which the tab already says — and
the ticket turns amber at 10 minutes and red at 15 (timer colour + card
border). The thresholds are constants, not settings: they follow the
mainstream KDS defaults, and nobody has asked to tune them. The 5 s poll
doubles as the timer tick. Completed tickets stop ageing; a done dish is no
longer waiting.

**The bump is the whole bottom of the card.** `Mark done` was a
footer-sized button beside Details; the finger pressing it is wet, gloved,
or holding a plate. It is now full-width and 48px tall. Recall (below) gets
the same target but an outline variant — it is the undo, not the job.

**Type at arm's length.** Place `text-xl`, items `text-base`, everything
else one step up from where it was. The board is read from across a pass,
not from a desk.

**Recall.** `POST …/kitchen-tickets/:ticketId/reopen`, gated on
`KITCHEN_STATUS_UPDATE` exactly like complete: whoever may say the food is
done may say it is not. D68's write surface grows its second verb — the
undo every mainstream KDS carries, because optimistic finger-sized bumps
are sometimes wrong. Reopening rewrites the ticket to `QUEUED` and CLEARS
`completedAt`/`completedByUserId` — a recalled ticket is work to do again,
and a stale "done by" name would say otherwise. Idempotent in mirror image
of complete: recalling a never-completed ticket writes nothing. Audited as
`KITCHEN_TICKET_REOPENED`. No migration: `QUEUED` already exists.

D94 is untouched: the till still holds `KOT_VIEW` alone, so it sees neither
verb, and WS-408's contrast still holds — its selectors (`Mark done`,
`Details` by accessible name) survived the relayout unchanged.
`kitchen-board.render.test.tsx` pins the new behaviour in pairs: escalation
(a late board turns red AND a fresh board carries no warning colour),
the write gate (no verbs without the permission, Details as the positive
control), and both verbs' optimistic card drop against api mocks that empty
their rows — a reload must not resurrect a bumped card.

### D101 — Sold out is a switch, not a count

PO, 2026-09-03: the restaurant catalogue behaved like a hardware store's.
Every item a restaurant authors carried stock fields, and the number in them
was one nothing maintains — a curry's `quantityOnHand` neither depletes nor
means anything, yet it rendered as though it did. The mainstream shape
(Toast, Square) splits availability by what the item IS:

**Prepared items don't count units — they get an 86 switch.** New nullable
`Product.soldOutAt` (null = available). `PUT /v1/products/:id/availability`
sets or clears it, gated on the new `PRODUCT_AVAILABILITY_SET` permission —
held by OWNER/ADMIN/MANAGER and, deliberately, by the food-service Waiter
and Cashier templates: 86ing the last kottu is a till/floor action in the
middle of service, not an owner's console visit. The endpoint REFUSES kinds
whose availability is governed elsewhere (`STOCK_ITEM`/`BUNDLE` by the
count; `TIME_SLOT`/`STAY_UNIT` by booking calendars) with
`PRODUCT_AVAILABILITY_STOCK_GOVERNED` — one authority per fact. The flag is
product-level, not per-branch, because LOCAL inventory already refuses
multi-branch tenants; when multi-branch food service arrives, this moves to
a branch satellite with its own decision record.

**Bought-in sellables keep real counts.** The D65 authoring rule
(`foodType != null → COMPOSED_ITEM`) made a tracked bottled water
impossible: the restaurant wizard stamps every item with a foodType, so a
packaged drink classified as a dish, reported UNTRACKED, and depleted
nothing. The rule gains the operator's own answer: the wizard's Track-stock
switch (restaurant default OFF — dishes are the common case) now travels as
`trackStock`, and `foodType != null` derives `STOCK_ITEM` when it is true,
`COMPOSED_ITEM` otherwise. Update re-derives only when one of the rule's
inputs (`type`, `foodType`, `trackStock`) is in the patch, so existing rows
keep their classification until someone actually edits the decision.

**The server refuses a sold-out sale.** `resolveRoundItemInputs` — the ONE
resolver both intake paths share (dine-in rounds and takeaway, which the
counter routes every mode through) — now throws `PRODUCT_SOLD_OUT` for a
sold-out product, next to the existing inactive check. POS greying is
usability; the refusal is the rule (D31's stance). Out-of-stock STOCK_ITEMs
are deliberately NOT blocked — oversell stays permitted, unchanged.

**Presentation is per-item, resolved in one place.** The sellable read
model reports `stockState: 'SOLD_OUT'` (a new state beside UNTRACKED — a
sold-out dish must not read as OUT, which stock governs). The web resolver
gains `resolveItemStockPresentation(presentation, sellableKind)`:
EXTERNAL_CATALOGUE shows counts for every kind (Tile Shop pixels untouched,
D16); LOCAL splits QUANTITY (STOCK_ITEM/BUNDLE) from AVAILABILITY
(COMPOSED_ITEM/SERVICE) from NONE (booking kinds); no component compares a
kind inline. At the POS, sold-out cards grey out and stop adding; a
long-press (the Square gesture) opens the availability dialog for untracked
items when the operator holds the permission.

### D102 — a page is never wider than it is tall

Report, 2026-09-01, on the D99 delivery: with the bill printing correctly, one
case was found where it comes out **rotated 90° on the roll** — the words run
along the paper instead of across it. To reproduce: clear every document field
(business name, address, phone, email, tax number, footer, bill note) **and**
the logo, then print a bill with **one** item.

**The mechanism.** `@page { size: W H }` has no separate orientation property.
The two lengths *are* the orientation: a page box whose width exceeds its
height **is** a landscape page, and the print pipeline rotates it to suit.

`fitPageToContent` measured the content and declared `size: <paperWidth>mm
<measuredHeight>mm`. Nothing bounded that height. Its only guard was
`heightPx <= 0`, and the geometry module's three `min` constants — the page
width's floor, the inset floor, `minContentMm` — are every one of them about
the horizontal axis. Strip the header and the bill falls under the paper's own
width, and the page turns over.

Measured in Chromium at the real 295 px layout width, not estimated:

| document | content | declared page | |
|---|---|---|---|
| normal bill, logo and header | ~520 px | 78 × 140 mm | portrait |
| **stripped bill, one item** | **213 px (56.4 mm)** | **78 × 59 mm** | **landscape** |
| **calibration strip** | **275 px (72.8 mm)** | **78 × 75 mm** | **landscape** |

**The instrument had the defect it was built to find.** That 78 × 75 mm is not
a calculation — it is what the D99 calibration strip was observed injecting on
the live stack the day it shipped. The strip prints through the identical path,
so the tool for diagnosing the last print bug was quietly carrying the next one.

**The rule.** The declared height is now floored at the paper width plus the
cutter margin — 80 mm on a 78 mm roll, 60 mm on a 58 mm one. It tracks whatever
roll the workspace calibrated rather than being another hard-coded 78, and it is
strictly greater than the width, never equal: a square page is the ambiguous
case and there is no reason to hand a driver one.

The floor earns its place twice. Orientation is the first reason. The second is
that a cut needs somewhere to land — the `+2 mm` cutter margin was already
admitting as much for the bottom of a long bill, and a 50 mm page gives the
mechanism less paper than the head-to-cutter distance on most 80 mm printers.

The arithmetic moved out of `fitPageToContent` and into `pageHeightMm` in
`thermal-bill-geometry.ts`, beside the rest of the geometry, with
`CUTTER_MARGIN_MM` following it. The number that decides which way up the bill
comes out should not be computed in the middle of DOM code, and it is now
testable without a browser.

**Cost, stated plainly.** A very short receipt gets up to about 30 mm of blank
paper before the cut. That is the trade, it is bounded, and it disappears the
moment a bill has a letterhead or a second line.

**What D77 keeps, untouched.** The fitting is still opt-in and still measured;
the template still declares no `@page { size }` of its own. Every height failure
D77 records is a height too **large** — 432 mm and then 223 mm, scaled down by a
driver that could not honour them — and it drew the right conclusion from them.
This is the opposite end of the same axis, which nothing in D73–D99 had cause to
consider. D79's Xprinter dialog is the same story: it states a *Maximum* Length
and no minimum at all.

**An empty header no longer prints a blank line.** Every row in the header block
is conditional, but the block itself was not, so a workspace with the logo and
all four fields cleared got an empty `div` holding the template's own newlines.
Whitespace in a block still generates a line box, and nothing in that stylesheet
sets a `font-size` on `body`, so it inherited the browser's 16 px and printed as
a blank line at the top of the paper. It is emitted only when it has content
now. Adjacent to the reported bug rather than part of it, and recorded so.

**Why the suite did not catch this, which is the D30 lesson here.** Every
`@page` assertion in the repository is driven by a fixture whose body reports
**1000 px** → 267 mm, comfortably portrait. The entire regime below the page
width had no coverage — not a weak test, no test. A tripwire cannot fail in a
region no fixture visits, and "all the assertions pass" said nothing about it.

Tripwires added, and mutation-proven inline:

- `thermal-bill-geometry.test.ts` — the rule as a **property**, swept across
  1…2000 px, requiring `pageHeightMm(g, px) > g.pageWidthMm` for every one,
  rather than sampling a few heights. Plus the floor tracking a 58 mm and a
  110 mm roll, asserted negatively against the 78 mm roll's 80 mm so a
  hard-coded default cannot pass. The mutation proof states the pre-D102
  arithmetic explicitly — `ceil(pxToMm(213)) + 2 === 59`, and `59 < 78` — because
  `pageHeightMm(g, 213) === 80` proves nothing unless 213 px is shown to sit in
  the landscape regime.
- `receipt-print.geometry.test.ts` — the same claim through the real
  `printReceipt`, since the pure function could be correct and simply not
  called. Exact injected set, with the old sideways output named as the
  negative.
- `thermal-bill.test.ts` — the header block absent when empty, present the
  moment one field is filled, so it cannot pass by deleting every letterhead.

**D16.** No existing assertion changed. Every `@page` spec uses the 1000 px
fixture, which is above the floor, so all of them still pass untouched — which
is itself the evidence that the normal printing path is unaffected.

**Verified:** the heights above were measured in a real browser rather than
computed; the reported case reprinted upright on the till.

### D103 — the rail entry is called "Menu", because that is what it is

PO, 2026-09-04: after D101 landed, "I can still see the inventory tab."
Correct on both counts it could mean, and both are fixed under this record.

**The label.** D45 made `/products` the single authoring surface and, when
it removed the legacy `/menu` nav entry, labelled the food-service rail
entry "Inventory" so it would read as that surface. It never did: every
mainstream restaurant POS calls this surface the **Menu** (Toast,
Lightspeed; Square says Items), and after D101 the word "Inventory" is
actively wrong — most of what a restaurant authors there deliberately has
NO inventory. The entry is now labelled **Menu** with a book icon
(`BookOpen` joins the icon vocabulary). Nothing else moved: the href is
still `/products`, retail still says "Products", and the D45 rule that the
legacy `/menu` ROUTE gets no nav entry stands — `nav.test.ts` now pins
that claim by href, which is the invariant, rather than by the absence of
a label that legitimately exists again.

**The detail page.** A dish's detail page still offered Inventory and
Purchases tabs — per-branch counts and GRNs behind two clicks, for an item
whose D101 stock cell says a count means nothing. Both tabs now render
only for items whose stock presentation is QUANTITY, the same resolver
answer that gates the Receive Stock button. Overview and History remain
for every kind; availability lives on the Overview, where D101 put it.

Paired per D30: the nav spec asserts the Menu label present AND resolving
to `/products`, `/menu` absent from every workspace's hrefs, and retail
free of the label; the detail spec asserts a dish hides the two tabs while
a stock item keeps them.

### D104 — one joined table, several tabs

PO, 2026-09-07, on the open tables shipped by D49/D50: "think I'm going with 3
friends, the waiter makes a table with join ex M1 and M2 all having 6 seats, we
want 4, then another two friends come — they also can book that new made group."

D50 already answers *two parties, shared furniture*, but with the multiplicity
the other way up: **N arrangements over 1 physical table**, each arrangement
carrying exactly one tab. The PO is describing **1 arrangement carrying N
tabs** — one named group the floor can keep selling seats on. Both shapes are
real and they are not substitutes: the first is two unrelated pairs who happened
to be sat at one four-top, the second is one joined table that is only half
full.

**The rule changes for `kind = OPEN` only.** `openSession`'s
one-live-session-per-table check becomes kind-aware: a PHYSICAL table still
refuses a second session — a four-top with a party at it is not something two
parties can both be sold — and an arrangement admits as many tabs as it has
chairs. The integration spec proves the relaxation is scoped by re-asserting the
physical refusal beside the arrangement's acceptance, and
`table-sessions.spec.ts`'s "the same table cannot have two open sessions"
survives untouched because its fixture is a physical table.

**Seats are counted, and the count is refused when it does not fit.** Live tabs
are `OPEN` or `BILLING` — a party waiting for the bill is still in its chairs
— and `guestCount` becomes required on an arrangement that HAS a recorded seat
count. Where the operator wrote "seating as arranged" and left it blank (D49's
optional `seats`), nothing is enforced: inventing a limit would refuse parties
on a number nobody stated. The one list of live statuses now lives in
`common/live-sessions.ts`, because "may another party sit here" and "may this
arrangement be dissolved" are the same question about the same rows and two
copies of the answer would drift.

**A tab carries its own name.** Two parties on one arrangement previously
produced byte-identical kitchen tickets and bill headers — the table's name was
the whole label. `TableSession.tabName` is composed onto the place label by one
helper used at all three read surfaces (kitchen board and ticket detail, bill,
unified order list). It is required from the **second** tab onwards, and only
then: naming a tab that has no sibling is typing for nothing, and a lone
arrangement already reads unambiguously.

**Release becomes last-*tab*-out.** This supersedes D49's "the arrangement ends
with the tab". `releaseOpenTable` now returns without touching memberships,
`isActive` or any member status while another live session remains on the open
table; only the last close dissolves the arrangement, after which D50's
member-level "still held by another open table" logic runs unchanged. The
ordering inside `closeSession` is load-bearing — it marks its own session
CLOSED *before* the fulfilment provider asks who is left, so a plain count
excludes the tab that is closing — and an integration test pins it. The release
summary gains `remainingTabs`, because "no member was freed" (a shared
four-top, normal) and "two parties are still sitting here" (nothing happened at
all) read identically without it.

**In the POS, arrangements live under Open.** D92's partition holds — every
table on the branch is in exactly one place — and an arrangement's place is
**Open**, whether or not a party is on it. Deliberately not filed by status like
a physical table: under this record an arrangement can be occupied AND still
have chairs, so status would make it flicker between destinations as parties
come and go, hiding the very table the next party is meant to join. A first pass
gave them a separate "Joined" chip; the PO wanted them under Open, which is also
the truer reading of D92. Tapping a group opens a small prompt for the guest
count and the tab name — physical tables keep their one-tap seat, because that
is the commonest action in service and a dialog on it would tax every cover to
serve the rarer case. Occupancy (`liveTabs`, `seatsTaken`) is computed by the
SERVER on `listOpenTables`: D70 scopes the open-session list to the caller's own
tabs, so a client adding up what it can see would miss a colleague's party and
offer seats that are not there.

**Not in scope.** Seat-level assignment (which chair): seats stay a count.
Moving or merging tabs. Reservations on arrangements — D49 still refuses
non-PHYSICAL tables. And note the claim "physical tables keep one tab" is about
`openSession`: takeaway and delivery already insert sessions directly on their
synthetic WALK-IN / DELIVERY tables and never pass through it, so nothing here
runs on those paths.

**Migration.** `20260908000000_add_table_session_tab_name`: one nullable TEXT
column. Purely additive — null on every existing row means "the table's name
stands alone", which is exactly what those rows already meant, since before this
record a table could not have a sibling tab to be distinguished from.

**Two assertions were superseded, not accommodated** (D16 forbids the latter):
`open-tables.service.spec.ts`'s "**always** archives the closing open table" —
"always" was load-bearing under D49 and is now conditional, replaced by the pair
(archives when last / leaves it standing when not) — and a POS render assertion
from the same day that a tap on an arrangement "still resumes rather than seating
a second session on it".

Paired per D30 throughout, and mutation-proven inline: the render spec's five
mutations fail 7/4/1/1/1 of its 7 tests (dropping the arrangement fetch kills
all seven, which is the shape of the original defect — total absence), and the
integration spec asserts every refusal beside the acceptance that proves the
server has not simply started saying no.

### D105 — a table already inside an open table is not offered to another one

PO, 2026-09-07, immediately after D104 landed: "in the main hall I joined M2
and M3, then after creating a join table [they still show] in that place" —
the **New open table** picker was still listing M2 and M3 while the arrangement
holding them, `minin`, was in service with three tabs and eight guests
physically at those two tables.

**This narrows D50 to `AVAILABLE` only.** D50 had widened member eligibility by
exactly one status, admitting `RESERVED` so two unrelated pairs could each hold
their own arrangement over one free four-top. That widening was sound while an
arrangement meant exactly ONE tab — "already shared" and "has a party at it"
were then mutually exclusive, which is what D50's own sentence *"a table with a
party physically at it is not shareable; a table already shared is"* relies on.

**D104 dissolved that distinction.** Occupancy is recorded on the arrangement,
never on its members: seating `minin` moves `minin` to OCCUPIED while M2 and M3
stay `RESERVED`. So after D104 a `RESERVED` row means "held by an arrangement,
which may or may not be full of people", and neither the service nor the picker
could tell the two apart from the row alone. The rule was not merely stale — it
was offering the floor tables that had guests sitting at them.

**Nothing is lost, because D104 replaced the mechanism.** D50's worked example
is now served better by a second **tab** on the existing arrangement than by a
second arrangement over the same furniture: one bill each, one named tab each,
and the physical tables released when the last of those tabs closes. Refusing
here is how the floor gets pushed onto that route rather than onto a duplicate
arrangement that no longer buys anything.

**What changes.** `DiningService.createOpenTable`'s eligibility becomes
`isActive && kind = PHYSICAL && status = AVAILABLE`. The picker's filter
narrows to match, its "shared" hint goes with the rule that produced it, and
its copy now names the replacement route instead of promising sharing. The
existing `MemberTableUnavailableError` is unchanged and its wording — *"it is
in service, archived, or already part of another open table"* — becomes true
for the first time.

**What deliberately does NOT change.** No migration and no schema change:
`OpenTableMember` stays many-to-many. Restoring
`@@unique([memberTableId])` would need a migration and would reject rows
already written under D50, and the service is the authority in any case — the
many-to-many shape simply stops being reachable through the create path. D50's
member-level last-one-out logic in `releaseOpenTable` stays as written, correct
and now practically unreachable, because it is what keeps rows created before
this record honest. `releaseMemberTable` (Unreserve) is untouched and remains
the escape hatch.

**One assertion was superseded, not accommodated** (D16 forbids the latter):
`open-tables.service.spec.ts`'s *"D50: a table already RESERVED by another open
table can be shared"*, which asserted the create RESOLVES. It is now its
opposite, and `RESERVED` joins the `it.each` refusal table beside SEATED /
OCCUPIED / BILLING / CLEANING / BLOCKED, which is the tidiest statement of the
new rule and leaves that test's message assertion untouched.

Paired per D30 in three places, and mutation-proven inline with measured
counts: the service spec asserts the refusal AND that nothing was written, and
restoring `|| RESERVED` to the predicate fails 2 of its 22 tests; the picker —
which had **no test at all** before this record — asserts a free table present
beside the joined ones absent, and the same restoration fails 2 of its 3; and
the integration spec refuses a member of an arrangement that is unseated AND
one that is in service, then proves the same tables become joinable again once
the last tab closes, which is what stops the pair passing against a server that
has simply started saying no.

---

### D106 — a joined table is shown, not offered

PO, 2026-09-07: "after the open table, like I join M1 and M3, then under the
Main Hall section it shows the table with the button Unreserve — I think don't
show, please. It shows Reserved status, can't click button. I think that is the
best."

It was more than a preference. Pressing that button is what broke the live
floor: `minin` was found serving **three tabs and eight guests while holding
zero tables** — M2 and M3 had been unreserved out from under the party sitting
on them.

**Why the guard never fired.** `releaseMemberTable` refused when the table had
its own live session:

    const ownSession = await tx.tableSession.findFirst({
      where: { tableId: table.id, status: IN_SERVICE_SESSION_STATUSES },
    });
    if (ownSession) throw new TableInServiceError();

A joined member never has a session of its own — the tab lives on the OPEN row —
so the check could not fire for exactly the case it appeared to cover. It read
like a safety rail and was one only for tables that were not joined.

**Why the permission is withdrawn rather than fixed in place.** D50 allowed this
deliberately, as the compaction escape hatch: two parties of three shared a
four-top and a two-top, the first is billed, and the remaining three now fit on
the four-top alone — only a human can see that. **D105 ended table sharing**, so
that scenario cannot arise: there is no second arrangement whose departure frees
furniture the first no longer needs. And **D104** made the failure expensive,
because an arrangement now carries several tabs and several parties.

**The card keeps its job, which was never the button.** A member table still
shows the `Reserved` badge and the "Held by …" line naming the arrangement —
that line is the whole answer to "where did my table go", and it is why the card
is worth reading. What it no longer has is anything to press. The badge wording
is unchanged on the PO's say-so, and it is shared with the dashboard and the POS
picker.

**Recovery was already correct and is now the only route.** Close the tabs — the
last one releases every member automatically (D104) — or **Dissolve** the
arrangement, which has always refused while a tab is live. An arrangement nobody
has sat at yet can still have a member released, which is the honest half of the
old behaviour and stays.

**Server, not just screen.** Frontend hiding is usability only, so the rule
moved into the service: `releaseMemberTable` now counts live tabs on the
**arrangements holding the member** and throws the existing
`OpenTableInServiceError`. The member's own-session check stays as well — a
table can be RESERVED and separately mid-service in states this method has no
business touching. No new error code, no new route, no migration; the endpoint
and its route-matrix entry are untouched.

Paired per D30 on both sides, and mutation-proven inline with measured counts:
the floor spec asserts the card's CONTENT and its EMPTY action slot as separate
tests, and restoring the button fails 1 of those 2; the service spec asserts the
refusal beside the still-working unseated release, and deleting the holder probe
fails 1 of its 23 tests and 2 of the 12 integration tests — which also assert
the membership row and the member's RESERVED status survive the refusal, and
that the member comes back by itself when the last tab closes.

### D107 — merging `main` into the restaurant branch: how each clash was decided

`feature/restaurant-pos-reshin` (131 commits since PR #8) was merged into
`merge/restaurant-changes`, a branch cut from `main`, which had moved on by 51
commits of its own: a `SALESPERSON` role, UTC storage with per-business
timezones, customer-level credit and receivables, per-unit fixed discounts,
numbered pagination, and QuickBooks fixes. Thirty files conflicted textually;
what follows is every decision that was more than "take both lines", so the
next person can see why the merged code reads as it does.

**Production's migrations are `main`'s, and none of them was touched.** The
one genuine migration clash: both branches created `Sale_tenantId_completedAt_idx`
— `main` in `20260901101500_index_sale_completed_at` (deployed) and this
branch inside `20260822000000_add_universal_settlement_document` (never
deployed). Two `CREATE INDEX` for one name fail whichever runs second, in
*either* order. The branch's migration gives the statement up; `main`'s is
byte-identical to what production has applied. Proven by replaying both
shapes on scratch databases: an empty one takes all 68 in order, and a
production-shaped one takes `main`'s 27 first, then the merged set — with a
credit-account payment (`saleId NULL`, `main`'s model) seeded in between and
still present afterwards, the index present exactly once, and zero drift
against the merged schema in both. The other narrowing this branch carries,
`PrintJob.saleId SET NOT NULL` (D68), touches a table `main` never changed.

**`SALESPERSON` joins the single role authority, owner-equivalent, exactly as
`main` defined it.** `main` added it as an enum role with `ALL_PERMISSIONS`,
no discount ceiling, and two copies of an `ADMIN_LEVEL_ROLES` /
`isAdminLevelRole` helper (API and web). This branch had already moved
`UserRole` into `packages/shared/authorization.ts` with a Prisma-enum parity
spec, so the role went there, the helper went there once, and both apps
re-export it. One real reconciliation: on `main`, "holds the full permission
set" and "is owner-level" were the same three roles. Here they are not —
ADMIN is owner-level for guard-rail overrides but Restaurant Pilot Change 1
withholds the six creator-scoped permissions from it — so `main`'s spec
asserting the two lists are equal now asserts them separately. The
consequence to notice: the salesperson holds `PLATFORM_PROFILE_MANAGE` and
every restaurant permission, and the parity spec that enumerated who may
change a workspace profile now names it. That is what owner-equivalent means;
it is recorded here because `main` never saw those permissions exist.

*Not done, deliberately, and flagged for a decision:* this branch has four
hard-coded `OWNER || ADMIN` checks `main` never touched — the branch-scope
bypass in `branch-scope.guard.ts`, the role-grant right in `users.service.ts`,
and two in `auth.repository.ts`. Main's own rule says `isAdminLevelRole` is
the only place that question should be answered, which would extend each of
them to the salesperson. They are security decisions on code `main` never had,
so they were left as they were rather than widened in a merge.

> **Resolved 2026-09-08 by [D108](#d108--the-salesperson-is-the-hardware-templates-role-with-a-row-of-its-own):**
> all of them now ask `isAdminLevelRole`, so the Salesperson is cross-branch
> and may hold branch access through the role, like the owner.

**The salesperson demo user exists; the manager and accountant do not come
back.** This branch retired both on 2026-08-17 and its seed actively deletes
them, so re-adding them would be undone on the same run. The e2e fixtures and
tests that depended on them (`accountantApi`, `managerApi`, PERM-008, and the
second user in MARK-016) were dropped or moved to the cashier; the four
salesperson tests `main` added were kept. No `SALESPERSON` role *template*
was added, so the seeded salesperson is unlinked and resolves through the
enum fallback — it works, and the platform console will show its role as
"Not set". Whether the hardware workspace should offer Salesperson as a
template is a product question, not a merge one.

> **Resolved 2026-09-08 by [D108](#d108--the-salesperson-is-the-hardware-templates-role-with-a-row-of-its-own):**
> the hardware template seeds a `SALESPERSON` row, `usr_salesperson` links to
> it, and the console shows "Salesperson".

**Per-unit discounts run through the one money engine.** `main` implemented
the `UNIT` basis twice in float arithmetic — the sale pipeline and the
quotation calc — each carrying a comment that it had to match the other to the
cent. This branch had already replaced both with `computeDocumentLine` (D59).
The engine learned the basis (`discountBasis`, multiply first, round once,
clamp at the line) and exports `discountAmountOf`, and both callers use it; a
quotation and the sale it becomes cannot now disagree because they no longer
have separate arithmetic. Proven with the engine's own specs, including the
half-cent case that distinguishes round-once from round-then-multiply.

**Timezones and document kinds compose.** `main` stamps receipts in the shop's
timezone; this branch labels a receipt with a local document kind when there
is no accounting provider. The receipt and return services take both.
`DocumentProfile` is now `DocumentSettings & { timezone }`, so the bill
preview (D96) builds one from the tab's unsaved values plus the page's
timezone state.

**Relocated, not conflicted.** `main`'s 16 hunks of retail-POS work
(credit-limit warning, invoice date, stock-tracking labels, pagination,
per-unit discount wording) were written against `app/(app)/pos/page.tsx`,
which this branch had reduced to a dispatcher after extracting that body
verbatim into `components/pos/pos-retail-checkout.tsx`. The diff was applied
to the extracted component instead; every hunk landed, and the two lines the
extraction had changed (the export and the D85 sheet height) are intact.

**Small unions worth naming.** `RestaurantConfig`-style route classification:
`main`'s two new routes are in the matrix — `GET /customers/:id/credit` under
the customers controller's class-level guard, and `POST /sales/:id/marked-paid`
given the route-level `RETAIL_POS` guard every other sales write carries.
`customers.repository.markQuickBooksSyncFailed` mirrors its status to
`ExternalEntityRef` like its sibling, per D63. `ProductsModule` imports
`SettingsModule` for the timezone-aware product report. The migration-set
tripwire lists all 68 with the eight from `main` annotated.

### D108 — the Salesperson is the hardware template's role, with a row of its own

**Decision (PO, 2026-09-08).** `SALESPERSON` is specific to the **hardware**
workspace template. It grants exactly what the hardware Owner grants — the same
permissions and the same screens — and it has a **linked role row**: a built-in
template keyed `SALESPERSON`, seeded into hardware workspaces and no others,
with the seeded demo salesperson linked to it like every other seeded user.

**Why.** D107 brought the role across from `main` as an enum value with a
permission set and nothing else. That left it half a role: authority resolved
through the legacy enum fallback, the platform console showed "Not set", the
workspace picker could not offer it, and — because the enum is platform-wide —
nothing said which kind of business the role belongs to. The product answer is
that a Salesperson is a hardware-shop job: the person on the counter who runs
the shop as the owner would. A restaurant, cafe, bakery or hotel has no such
post, and a template that appears in a picker is a template someone will
assign, so it is offered nowhere else.

**What changed.**

- **Template catalogue** (`packages/shared/src/types/role-templates.ts`).
  `BUILT_IN_ROLE_TEMPLATES` gains Salesperson (`isBuiltIn: true`, so a tenant
  cannot delete or edit it; `permissions: ROLE_PERMISSIONS.SALESPERSON`).
  `HARDWARE_ROLE_TEMPLATES` is now Owner, Salesperson, Cashier. GENERAL used to
  seed from the built-in list *as a whole*, which would have handed it the
  Salesperson by accident; it now selects Owner and Cashier explicitly through a
  new `GENERAL_ROLE_TEMPLATES`. Food-service and hotel lists are untouched.
  "Built in" now says who owns a role's definition; the per-template lists say
  who gets a row — the two were the same thing until this decision.
- **Authority by reference** (`authorization.ts`). `ROLE_PERMISSIONS.OWNER` and
  `ROLE_PERMISSIONS.SALESPERSON` are bound to one constant, not two spellings of
  `ALL_PERMISSIONS`. "The same as the owner" is a structural fact the parity
  spec asserts with `toBe`, not an equality that holds until someone edits one
  side. No permission changed hands: the set was already the owner's.
- **Owner-level checks that read the enum.** Five sites still decided
  cross-branch access on `role === 'OWNER' || role === 'ADMIN'`: the branch
  scope guard, `AuthRepository.hasBranchAccess` and `listAccessibleBranches`,
  and `UsersService`'s `roleGrant` and last-branch revoke guard. All five now
  ask `isAdminLevelRole`, the one place that answers "is this role
  owner-level" (D107), so a salesperson reaches every active branch exactly as
  the owner does. This is the "same UI" half of the decision: the accessible
  branches, the branch-scoped screens and the branch-access console treat the
  two identically. Nothing else in the web app keys on the enum — navigation
  derives from permissions and modules, the dashboard resolver already sent
  SALESPERSON to the admin dashboard, the discount ceiling was already
  unlimited, and the product screens already used `isAdminLevelRole`. The one
  visible difference is the profile chip, which prints the enum: "Salesperson".
- **Seed and provisioning.** The demo `usr_salesperson` is linked by
  `linkUsersToRoles` on key match, like the owner and the cashier, so it
  resolves from the database and the console shows "Salesperson". A hardware
  workspace created from the platform console seeds the row through the same
  `seedTenantRoles` call as its other roles; the console's role picker reads
  the workspace's own rows (D55.1) and so offers Salesperson in a hardware
  workspace and in no other. `baseUserRoleFor('SALESPERSON')` already mapped to
  its own enum value. `provision-tenant.ts` — the command-line production path
  — never linked anyone to a row; it now validates each `--user` role against
  the business type's templates (a SALESPERSON in a restaurant is refused, not
  left on the fallback as an owner-equivalent) and links every user on
  creation.
- **Reserved keys.** A custom role keyed `SALESPERSON` in a restaurant would
  have mapped to the owner-level enum underneath and been adopted — marked
  built-in, permissions `set` to the owner's — by the next role seed. So
  `RolesService.create` now refuses every enum value and template key
  (`ROLE_KEY_RESERVED`), and `seedTenantRoles` refuses, rather than adopts, a
  tenant-created row under a template key, and names a display-name collision
  before writing instead of failing on the unique constraint half-way through.
  `linkUsersToRoles` links to active rows only. The hole predates this
  decision (ADMIN, MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT keys were free everywhere); D108 is
  where it became worth closing because it is the first template offered to
  one business type and withheld from the rest.
- **Tests.** The parity spec pins seven templates, the exact built-in and
  non-built-in sets, the exact hardware set, the absence of Salesperson from
  every business type in `BUSINESS_TYPE_VALUES` but HARDWARE with a positive
  control per type, the by-reference binding, and mutation proofs for a
  narrowed salesperson and a leaked template; the domain-registry spec pins
  the same "HARDWARE only" fact at the registry. `branch-scope.guard.spec.ts`
  (new) proves with a Prisma stub that the set of roles the guard passes
  without a grant is exactly `ADMIN_LEVEL_ROLES`, and mutation-proves it by
  loading the real guard with `isAdminLevelRole` reverted to the old
  `OWNER || ADMIN` and showing the set collapse; the quotations and
  workspace-roles unit specs derive their owner-level sets from the same
  authority. Integration: role-seeding (the row, its permissions, the two
  refusals, linking), workspace-provisioning (the console's role list and a
  console user on the Salesperson row), role-authority (a SALESPERSON user
  links in a hardware tenant and not in a restaurant), role-management (the
  exact tenant-facing role list, the built-in's immutability, the reserved
  key, and the enum column moving with the row on assignment and demotion),
  branch-scope (cross-branch reach for every owner-level role and refusal for
  every other), platform-profile (every enum value in the read and write
  matrices) and discount-approval (a salesperson PIN approves beyond the
  manager cap). Web: the console users test's fixtures are the real hardware
  and restaurant sets, and the rail, settings and shell specs assert the
  Salesperson renders the owner's surface. End to end: PERM-014 (the
  salesperson's rail equals the owner's in a browser), PERM-015 (a 50% line
  discount needs no approval from a salesperson and is refused for a cashier)
  and PERM-016 (the seeded salesperson resolves from its row).

**No migration.** The enum value already exists (`main`'s
`20260831090920_add_salesperson_role`); the row is data, written by
`seedTenantRoles`, which is idempotent and never deletes.

**Rollout to existing hardware tenants.** Production has had the `Role` table
since the initial migration, empty: the two role migrations were additive and
wrote no data, and `main`'s seed seeds no roles. So after this merge deploys,
the pilot's users — its salesperson included — keep resolving through the
legacy fallback until the tenant's rows are seeded and they are linked. That
is an operator step, deliberately not a migration (§12.1): the new
`prisma/backfill-tenant-roles.ts <slug> [--write]` runs the catalogue sync,
`seedTenantRoles` for the tenant's business type (a no-profile tenant is
HARDWARE, D57) and `linkUsersToRoles` in one transaction, lists the users it
cannot link (an enum with no template — MANAGER, ACCOUNTANT, ADMIN — is a
re-role decision for a person), and refuses on any collision with a
tenant-created role. `role-authority-report.ts` is the confirmation. The
runbook (`06-migration-and-rollout.md`) carries the step. Nothing is lost in
the gap: a fallback salesperson holds the same permissions; only the console's
"Not set" and row-based resolution wait on it. (D87 and D94 say their template
grants reach existing users "through `pnpm db:seed`"; that is true of the
development tenants only — on production the same backfill is the path.)

**Not changed, on purpose.** The demo salesperson still has no PIN, as `main`
decided. PINs only answer in-POS approval prompts here (D48), so the practical
meaning is that the seeded salesperson cannot act as an approver in the demo
while the owner's 2222 can; a real salesperson is given a PIN like any other
user. The seed comment now states the difference instead of claiming the
credentials mirror the owner's.

### D109 — the account menu names the person and their role, nothing else

**Decision (PO, 2026-09-08).** The menu behind the profile button in the
header shows the user's name and role. The two lines beneath them — the branch
("Main Dining") and the register ("Counter 1") — are removed.

**Why.** The menu is about the account: who is signed in, what they are, and
the way out. The till's location is a property of the session, not of the
person, and on a one-branch, one-register shop the two lines were the same
noise under every name. Nothing else changes: the session still carries the
branch and register for the screens that need them, and the header's own
branch and register chips were already gone (DASH-015).

### D110 — merging `fix/table-tab`: how each clash was decided

`origin/fix/table-tab` (nine commits, 2026-09-01 to 09-08, branched from the
restaurant tip `4f0be1b`) was merged into `merge/restaurant-changes` after D107
had brought `main` in and D108/D109 had landed. It carries D99–D106: roll
calibration, the kitchen board's ergonomics and ticket recall, the 86 switch,
print geometry, the "Menu" rail entry, one joined table with several tabs and
its two follow-ups — plus `roleName` on the session, the customer capture
popup's address fields, the order detail drawer, the reservation dialog,
QuickBooks-gated customer screens with mobile-number validation, and a
portalled tooltip. Ten files conflicted; what follows is every decision that
was more than "take both".

**Decision numbers.** Both branches appended after D98. Theirs cite D99–D106 in
code, specs and two migrations; today's three records were newer and cited by
nothing outside this branch, so they moved up — D99→D107, D100→D108,
D101→D109 — in one commit before the merge, every reference and anchor
included. The log now reads in the order the decisions were made.

**The unnamed migration is dropped.** Their branch carried
`20260831055102_setup1`: a DROP and re-ADD of `InventoryReceiptLine_productVariantId_fkey`
with `ON DELETE SET NULL`. That is the D44 drift — the migration wrote
`RESTRICT`, the schema declares the relation without `onDelete` and so means
`SetNull` — which every feature migration since `20260826` deliberately strips
from `migrate diff`'s output, and their own tripwire refused to count it: "its
owner must add a decision record for it or remove it". Removed. Production
never had it; a developer database that applied it needs a `prisma migrate
reset` (or its `_prisma_migrations` row deleted and the constraint re-added as
`RESTRICT`) — `migrate resolve --rolled-back` only takes a migration that
failed. The drift itself is unchanged and still stripped; whether `RESTRICT`
or `SetNull` is the intended behaviour for a variant a receipt line still
references is open (O6).

**Production's migrations are `main`'s, and none was touched.** The merged
set is 70: this branch's 60, `main`'s 8 and their two, both purely additive
nullable columns (`Product.soldOutAt`, `TableSession.tabName`) on tables the
feature migrations create earlier in lexical order. Proven as D107 was: an
empty database applies all 70 and `migrate status` reads up to date; a database
at `main`'s 27, with a customer-account payment (`saleId NULL`) seeded in
between, applies the remaining 43 and keeps the row, holds
`Sale_tenantId_completedAt_idx` once, and reads up to date. On both, `migrate
diff` emits exactly the D44 FK pair and nothing else.

**Their role display, our menu.** The account menu shows their
`roleName` — the role row's name, so a waiter reads "Waiter" rather than the
CASHIER enum underneath, falling back to the enum for a session minted before
the field existed — inside D109's two-line menu with no branch or register.

**`main`'s pagination stays.** Both the sales and customers lists conflicted
between `main`'s one `Pagination` component (D107: "numbered pagination
everywhere, from one component") and their older hand-rolled pager, which hid
itself when the total fit the smallest page size. The component won; the
hide-when-small rule did not survive, and is recorded here as a product
question rather than silently re-added inside a merge.

**The customers list keeps `main`'s columns and takes their gating.** "Credit
limit" and "Available credit" (with the hover explanation) stay; the Sync
column, the QuickBooks badges and the QuickBooks detail fields on the customer
page render only when the QUICKBOOKS module is enabled, resolved from the
platform profile (D31) — a restaurant customer no longer sees "Not synced".
Their commit also dropped the **Type** column (Retail / Wholesale / Credit)
from the list. The merge restored it for want of a stated reason; the PO
confirmed the same day that the removal was intentional, so it is gone
again — the Type filter above the list stays, as their branch left it. The
empty-state `colSpan` mirrors the header row in one named constant (five
fixed columns plus Sync) instead of two scattered literals.

**One tooltip, `main`'s.** Both sides replaced the CSS-only tooltip with a
portalled one for the same clipping reason. `main`'s follows the trigger on
scroll, clamps to the viewport edges and guards server rendering; theirs
dismissed on scroll. `main`'s is kept whole; nothing imported anything else
from theirs.

**The settings preview takes both props.** Their `set` and `showCalibration`
(D99's calibration strip lives on the Preview tab) and `main`'s `timezone`
(a document profile is the settings plus the shop's zone).

**Tests and the catalogue.** Their branch changed nothing under `apps/e2e`,
so D103's relabel left three Playwright assertions pinning the old rail
(RPW-001, WS-401, WS-402: "Inventory" present, "Menu" absent); all three now
assert the D103 rail, positively and negatively. Their seed ships three dishes
86'd, and the tablet counter spec clicked "the first priced tile", which can
now be a disabled one; it clicks the first enabled tile. Their orders list
became a page object (`items`, `total`, `page`, `pageSize`) and stopped
reading `limit`; the two counter specs that read it as an array (POS-CTR-301,
POS-CTR-401) now read the page. Those two still fail for an older reason —
they expect a seeded "Chicken Kottu" with modifiers that no seed has carried
since before D99 — which is recorded with the other pre-existing browser
failures rather than fixed here. Their eight decisions
added no rows to `testcases.md`; rows are added under the existing prefixes,
and UI-006, which still described the account menu D109 emptied, is corrected.
The header gains a render test for the two-line menu and the `roleName`
fallback, which neither D109 nor their change had.

**What their permission reaches.** D101's `PRODUCT_AVAILABILITY_SET` is
granted to the food-service Waiter and Cashier templates and, through
`ALL_PERMISSIONS`, to OWNER and ADMIN and MANAGER — and to SALESPERSON, which
is the owner's set by reference (D108). Their branch never saw that role;
recorded here the way D107 recorded what `main` never saw.

**Route matrix.** 288 routes, 200 module-guarded, 88 ungated: their three
(availability, ticket reopen, order detail) and `main`'s two (customer credit,
marked-paid), totals taken from the spec that checks the document.

**Open, for a product decision — tracked as O6 and O7.** (1) Whether a
variant still referenced by a receipt line may be deleted with the line's
reference nulled (`SetNull`, the schema's meaning) or must be refused
(`RESTRICT`, the database's behaviour); settling it ends the churn with either
an explicit `onDelete: Restrict` in the schema (no migration) or a named
migration. (2) Whether the pager should hide when a list fits one page — their
Orders screen still does; every `main` list renders it.

### D111 — the kitchen board rings for tickets it has not seen

PO, 2026-09-04: "i created new order but in restaurant view or cashier
kitchen view not sounding." The orders queue had a chime since it was
built; the kitchen board — the screen a kitchen is NOT staring at between
tickets — had none. Every mainstream KDS beeps on ticket arrival; a
silent wall-mounted board is a dish nobody starts.

The board now rings the same synthesised two-note chime the orders queue
uses (`lib/restaurant/new-order-chime.ts` — built for "live queue
screens", now finally plural), on the same baseline discipline: the first
load never rings, a filter switch re-baselines instead of ringing for
cards that merely became visible, and audio stays best-effort (a blocked
autoplay drops the ding rather than queueing a burst).

Two deliberate differences from the queue's rule:

**Ids, not a total.** The queue compares `total` because its list is
paged and ids shift between pages. The board is unpaged, so the baseline
is the id SET, and a poll rings when an unseen id appears — including
when one ticket is bumped in the same poll another arrives, where a count
stays flat through exactly the arrival the pass must hear.

**Only "To make" rings.** A new id on the Done tab is someone bumping,
not work arriving. A ticket appearing on To make because ANOTHER screen
recalled it does ring: to this pass it is new work regardless of why.

Deliberately NOT gated on `KITCHEN_STATUS_UPDATE`: D94 gives the till
`KOT_VIEW` alone precisely so a read-only board can hang where food is
made; a chime keyed to the write permission would silence the one
mounting that needs it most. Sound follows the screen, not the role —
the same reason the orders queue rings for whoever watches it.

Paired per D30 in `kitchen-board.render.test.tsx`: silent first load
with tickets rendered (positive control), ring on an unseen id, silence
on an unchanged poll, ring on bump+arrival with the count flat, and
silence across a filter switch and Done-tab growth. Verified live on the
dev stack: oscillator instrumentation shows 0 notes opening either
screen and exactly one two-note chime on the poll after a takeaway order
lands, on both `/kitchen` and `/orders`.

---

### D112 — the floor hears the bump: a food-ready bell on the tables screen

PO, 2026-09-04, closing the loop D111 opened: sounds now travel TO the
kitchen (order chime) but not back FROM it. Every mainstream expo flow
has the return signal — the kitchen bumps, the runner is paged, the food
does not die under the lamp. The waiter-facing half did not exist here.

**The signal path is open-sessions, not the kitchen board.** The waiter
template deliberately lacks `KOT_VIEW` ("a waiter has no business on the
kitchen display") and this record does not weaken that: instead
`GET /open-sessions` — the route that already answers "my tables", D70
scope and all — now carries `readyTicketIds` per session: the ids of its
COMPLETED kitchen tickets, resolved by one extra query walking ticket →
round → order → session. Ids rather than a count or a flag, so the
client can ring exactly once per NEW bump, and so a recalled ticket
takes its acknowledgement with it when it leaves the list — a re-bump
is fresh news and rings again. Asserted through the real routes in
`kitchen-board.spec.ts`: empty before the bump, the id after, empty
again after recall.

**The floor plan gets its first live loop.** `/tables` loaded once and
went stale; it now refreshes SESSIONS every 8 s (visible-tab gated,
catch-up on return — the orders queue's cadence and manners; 5 s is the
kitchen's urgency, not the floor's). The furniture (areas, tables) keeps
its explicit loads: admin-cadence data has no business on a poll.

**A bell, not the chime.** Two taps on one note (E6·E6) against the
order chime's rise (A5→D6) — distinguishable across a room, which is the
entire job of a second sound. Same synth module, same autoplay manners
(first load never rings, blocked audio drops the ding).

**The badge and its acknowledgement.** The ring points at a card:
"Food ready" with a concierge bell on the table (joined open tables
included). There is no "served" verb to clear it server-side — carrying
the plate IS the acknowledgement — so opening the order (View order)
answers the bell per device, persisted in sessionStorage exactly like
the POS cart. Another tablet's bell keeps ringing until ITS holder
looks: serving is whoever carried the plate.

Paired per D30 in `table-floor.ready.render.test.tsx`: first-load
silence WITH a standing badge (the positive control that separates
"state to read" from "arrival to announce"), ring+badge on a new bump,
silence on repeat, ack clearing without reviving, and the
recall-then-rebump second ring. Verified live: floor open on M5 =
0 notes; ticket bumped through the kitchen route = one E6·E6 bell
(instrumented frequencies 1319/1319) and one Food-ready badge inside
the 8 s window.

Housekeeping under this record: `global-setup.ts` of the integration
suite spawns `pnpm.cmd` through a shell on win32 — before that, ENOENT
killed every integration spec on a Windows dev machine before the first
test.

---

### D113 — the board gets a Preparing state, and the queue follows the kitchen

PO, 2026-09-04: "in kitchen view there is only option as mark done. but
in there add option to preparing, then done, so when that happen need to
update orders page according to status change. please do like industry
pos system handle." Which is exactly the mainstream KDS bump bar: a
ticket is NEW, someone taps it and it is COOKING, they tap again and it
is BUMPED — and the order status the rest of the house sees is driven by
those taps, not by anyone re-typing it.

**One enum value is the whole schema change.** `KitchenTicketStatus`
gains `IN_PROGRESS` (migration `20260908000000_…`, ALTER TYPE ADD VALUE
IF NOT EXISTS — additive, no rows, no defaults). The board's OUTSTANDING
filter already means "not COMPLETED", so a started ticket stays exactly
where outstanding work belongs. D111's chime baseline diffs ids, not
statuses, so starting rings nothing.

**The derivation was already waiting.** The Orders queue's
`unifiedStatusForRestaurantOrder` has mapped round IN_PROGRESS/READY
since the queue was built — dead branches, because nothing ever moved a
round. `syncKitchenProgress` now RESTATES the ticket set onto the round
after every kitchen verb (any started/bumped → IN_PROGRESS, all bumped →
READY, recall recomputes honestly — DELIVERED and CANCELLED are floor
verdicts the kitchen never touches), and the queue lights up with no
change to the queue itself. The unit spec pins the once-dead branches.

**Takeaway advances with the kitchen, forward only.** The profile is
what the customer was told, so the kitchen moves it
PLACED → IN_KITCHEN → READY as it works, never backward past that — with
one exception: a recall retracts READY to IN_KITCHEN, because "your food
is ready" has stopped being true. It retracts to IN_KITCHEN even if
nothing is cooking at that moment, never to PLACED. HANDED_OVER stays
the cashier's alone (it settles the Sale); the manual stepper keeps
working and the kitchen never overrides a cashier who stepped ahead.

**On the board: one verb per state.** Start preparing (chef hat) on a
queued card, Mark done on a started one — never both stacked; two 48px
buttons would halve the tickets a pass can see, and the taps are
adjacent in time anyway. Starting swaps the card IN PLACE (verb flips,
a warning-tone Preparing badge joins the age timer, which keeps
counting from creation); only the bump still drops the card. Start is
idempotent and a stale start never un-completes a bumped ticket —
Recall stays the only path down, and recall still lands on QUEUED
(D100 unchanged): the cook taps Start again if the pan is already on.

WS-408's till contrast now matches "any write verb" (`start preparing|
mark done`) — the claim was always "the till cannot work the board",
not the absence of one label. Paired per D30: board render tests pin
one-verb-per-state both ways plus the in-place flip; a new
`unified-status.spec.ts` pins the derivation branch by branch;
integration proves the whole ripple through the real routes (ticket →
round → unified feed → takeaway profile, up on start/bump and back
down on recall). Verified live: tapping Start preparing on /kitchen
flipped the card, /orders showed "Preparing" and then "Ready" on its
own poll after the bump, and the takeaway profile advanced
PLACED → IN_KITCHEN → READY untouched by hand.

---

### D114 — the counter hears the handover: a ready bell on the Orders queue

PO, 2026-09-07: when an order goes Ready, the cashier's queue moved the
row and ticked the Ready tab — silently. Mainstream systems put a sound
on exactly one slice of readiness: the alert follows **whoever hands
the food over**. Dine-in readiness pages the floor (D112's bell,
built); a takeaway or third-party order going READY is the counter's
news — bag it, call the name or the rider — and the counter heard
nothing.

**One number from the server.** The queue's envelope gains
`readyHandoverCount`: READY rows on TAKEAWAY + THIRD_PARTY, tallied in
the same derivation pass as `statusCounts` — before the status filter,
after channel/search — and DINE_IN is excluded on purpose: a till that
dings for every plated table is noise, and that bell already rings
where the runner is. Counted server-side because the page only sees 25
rows of whatever tab is open; the tally sees the whole picture.

**The bell rings whichever tab is open.** The page keeps a second
baseline (keyed on channel|search, NOT status — the tally ignores the
status tab, so reading "Pending" must not deafen the counter), rings
`playFoodReadyChime` — the same E6·E6 service bell the floor uses, one
sound per meaning across the house — only when the count GROWS, and
re-baselines on filter changes. A falling count (a handover) is silent;
the next order up rings again. First load never rings: bags already on
the pass are state to read, not an arrival.

Paired per D30: the polling suite pins silent-first-load-with-ready,
ring-on-growth with the order chime explicitly NOT firing (total flat —
the two sounds stay distinguishable), silence on the falling count then
ring on the next rise, ring across a status tab, re-baseline on a
channel switch; integration pins the tally through the real routes —
0 while in kitchen, 1 on the takeaway bump, 0 again on recall, and 0
for a READY DINE-IN order (the negative that keeps the till quiet for
the floor's food). Verified live: /orders open on the Pending tab,
baseline silent; the kitchen bumped RO-000059 and the queue rang
1319/1319 Hz inside the poll window.

The sound story is now closed on every screen that owns a next move:
order in → rising chime where it lands (kitchen D111, queue D111);
food up → service bell where the handover lives (floor D112 for
dine-in, counter D114 for takeaway/third-party).

### D115 — four lanes on the board, and cancellation finally reaches the pass

PO, 2026-09-07: "kitchen add to tabs called preparing and cancelled."
The board's two tabs become the bump bar's four lanes — **To make ·
Preparing · Done · Cancelled** — each ticket in exactly one.

**Preparing is a view, not a fetch.** To make and Preparing split the
one outstanding list client-side (queued family vs IN_PROGRESS), so
flipping between them is instant, both chips carry live counts at once,
and D111's chime keeps a single baseline across the pair — keyed on the
FETCH now, not the tab, so an arrival rings whichever of the two the
cook is reading. Start moves the card one lane along instead of
flipping it in place: the D113 flow, now with somewhere to move to.

**Cancelled fixes a real hole.** Tickets have no cancelled status —
cancellation lives on the order side (today only the takeaway profile
is ever written; the read also honours a cancelled round or order so a
future cancel verb lands here for free) — and until now it never
reached this screen: **the kitchen kept cooking food nobody was coming
for.** The `CANCELLED` pseudo-filter (a peer of D68's OUTSTANDING)
collects called-off work at any ticket status, newest first;
OUTSTANDING and COMPLETED now exclude it, so cancelling pulls the
ticket off the working lanes mid-cook and Done never celebrates a dish
that was called off after the bump. The lane's cards are read-only —
muted, red badge, no age (nobody is waiting), Details only: there is
nothing left to DO to dead work but see what it was.

Deliberately not yet: a cancellation sound (the lane and its count say
it; a red klaxon can come if the pilot loses food to unseen cancels),
and item-level voids on tickets (KitchenTicketItem is a snapshot with
no link to the order item — schema work for its own record).

Paired per D30: render tests pin the lane split both ways (Start on To
make / Mark done on Preparing, never both; the started card leaving one
lane AND arriving in the other), the Cancelled lane's badge + absent
verbs with Details as the positive control, and the till still naked of
verbs on both working lanes; integration pins the read through the real
cancel — on the board before, gone from OUTSTANDING and listed under
CANCELLED after, and a completed-then-cancelled ticket leaving Done
too. Verified live: cancelled the leftover RO-000049 takeaway — its
ticket left To make and sat alone in the Cancelled lane (screenshot),
chips carrying live counts.

*(Superseded in part by D116, same day: the board's Cancelled LANE was
removed — the read exclusions and the CANCELLED pseudo-filter stand.)*

---

### D116 — cancelling is the queue's verb, not the kitchen's

PO, 2026-09-07, on seeing D115's lane: "remove cancel from kitchen add
it to orders page and need option to cancel the order." Which is the
cleaner division of labour: **the kitchen decides doneness, the counter
decides whether an order still exists.** The board goes back to three
lanes — To make · Preparing · Done — and cancelled work simply vanishes
from it (D115's read exclusions stand unchanged; so does the CANCELLED
pseudo-filter, unsurfaced, for whatever later wants to list called-off
work). The strip is pinned as the exact three-label set so a lane
cannot creep back unnoticed.

**Cancel order lives in the queue's drawer.** For a takeaway row still
in play — not handed over (a settled Sale is refund territory), not
completed or already cancelled — the drawer offers a danger-styled
Cancel order behind a confirm dialog that names the order, the customer
and the item count. It drives the EXISTING takeaway status machine
(`PATCH /restaurant/takeaway/:profileId/status`, permission
`TAKEAWAY_CREATE` — the same hands that create takeaways may cancel
them) rather than growing a parallel cancel route; the detail view
gains `takeawayProfileId` so the drawer can address it. On success the
queue refetches at once (new `onMutated` plumbing) and the kitchen's
ticket leaves the board on its next poll via D115's read.

Deliberately narrow: **dine-in has no queue-side cancel** — its items
are voided at the table, where the bill lives, under ORDER_VOID_SENT's
deliberate restrictions; **third-party rows** belong to the platform
that sent them. The button is absent, not disabled, where it does not
apply — the View-bill rule.

Paired per D30: the drawer suite pins eligibility from both sides (a
live takeaway offers it; handed-over, dine-in, and an unpermitted
viewer do not), the confirm flow to the exact API call, and backing
out calling nothing; the board suite pins the exact lane strip.
Verified live end-to-end: RO-000051 on the kitchen board → cancelled
from the Orders drawer (confirm dialog screenshot) → row reads
Cancelled at once → the board no longer shows it.

---

### D117 — payment settles; handover is a hand

> **Superseded 2026-09-11 on its tab strip by [D179](#d179--a-completed-tab-and-all-orders-is-the-live-queue):** a Completed tab exists and the Handed over tab is folded into it. The settle/handover split this record made is unchanged.

PO, 2026-09-07: "i found the bug, when takeaway place it shows handed
over. but it need to show like other pending, preparing, handed over,
also no need completed tab hide it." Correct on both counts. The
counter popup's step 2 was `updateStatus(HANDED_OVER)` — not because
the bag had crossed the counter, but because handover was the only
verb that closed the session into a Sale for payment to land on. The
side effect was the bug: every counter order read "Handed over" for
its entire cook time, and D113's kitchen-driven statuses could never
touch it (forward-only stops at what the customer was told).

**Money and handover are different instants.** New
`POST /restaurant/takeaway/:profileId/settle` closes the session into
a Sale — totals via the shared calculator, lines via the fulfilment
projection, the exact block handover used, now extracted as
`settleSessionIntoSale` and shared — while the profile keeps its
lifecycle status. Idempotent (an already-CLOSED session returns its
Sale); refuses a CANCELLED order; same TAKEAWAY_CREATE permission.
The popup's step 2 becomes settle: the customer pays up front as
before, the receipt still prints from the Sale (D98 untouched), and
the order now reads **Pending, paid** — flowing Preparing → Ready as
the kitchen works (D113), ringing the counter's bell on READY (D114).

**Handover becomes a button.** The queue drawer gains one-tap
"Mark handed over" beside D116's Cancel (no confirm — it is the
routine positive act), driving the same status verb, which now REUSES
the settled Sale rather than minting one. The takeaway workspace's
stepper still works unchanged for unsettled (waiter-created) orders,
where handover still creates the Sale.

*PO amendment, same day: the button is offered ONLY on READY rows —
food the kitchen has not called up cannot be handed to anyone, and a
skip-the-kitchen button invites exactly the premature "Handed over"
this record kills. The workspace stepper stays the deliberate escape
hatch. Pinned both ways in the drawer suite (absent on PENDING and
IN_PROGRESS with Cancel present as the positive control).*

**No Completed tab.** COMPLETED is the dine-in shell's closed state;
its rows stay reachable under All Orders and an old
`?status=COMPLETED` bookmark still filters — the strip now shows the
lifecycle the counter actually works: Pending → Preparing → Ready →
Handed over, plus Cancelled.

Paired per D30: integration walks the whole life — placed+settled is
PLACED with a Sale, settle again returns the SAME Sale, the kitchen
still advances a settled order, handover reuses the Sale, and a
cancelled order refuses to settle (400); the drawer suite pins the
one-tap handover to its exact call and its absence on a handed-over
row. Verified live: create → settle → pay (the popup's exact calls)
read PENDING/paid on the queue, Preparing on start, Ready on bump,
Handed over from the drawer with the Sale id unchanged — and the tab
strip reads exactly All · Pending · Preparing · Ready · Handed over ·
Cancelled.

### D118 — sound lives in the kitchen alone

PO, 2026-09-07: "remove sound from waiter and cashier, only need
kitchen staff kitchen." Two days of D111–D114 built a sound per screen;
the PO ran it and wants one: the kitchen's new-ticket chime stays,
everything else goes quiet. Their restaurant, their ears — and it is a
defensible shape: the kitchen is the one station facing AWAY from its
screen, while the counter and the floor look at theirs.

Removed: the orders queue's arrival chime (D111's second home) and the
food-ready bell on BOTH the waiter floor (D112) and the queue (D114).
Kept, deliberately: every VISUAL signal those sounds accompanied — the
floor's "Food ready" badge with its per-device ack and
recall-re-badges behaviour, the queue's Ready tab and counts — and the
server's `readyHandoverCount` tally (integration-tested, one field,
the bell's whole backend) so re-inviting a sound is a frontend-only
change. The audio module shrinks to the kitchen chime and remains the
single home for POS audio.

Pinned as tripwires, not deletions: the polling suite re-runs the
exact polls that used to ring (total growth, handover-tally growth)
against a fully-stubbed audio module — including the REMOVED export
under its old name — and asserts silence with the fetches proven; the
floor suite keeps every badge behaviour and asserts the ring-poll
badges without sound. The kitchen board's chime tests are untouched.

### D119 — merging `fix/issues-restaurant`: how each clash was decided

`origin/fix/issues-restaurant` (three commits, 2026-09-07 and 09-08, cut from
`fix/table-tab` on 09-04 — before that branch's joined-table tabs) was merged
into `merge/restaurant-changes` after D110. It carries D111–D118: the kitchen
board's new-ticket chime, the food-ready badge on the tables screen, the
Preparing state and the bump bar's Start, the ready bell on the orders queue,
the board's lanes and cancellation reaching the pass, cancelling as the
queue's verb, payment settling without handing over, and sound living in the
kitchen alone — plus the product wizard's validation and character limits.
Five files conflicted.

**Decision numbers, again.** The branch numbered its eight records D104–D111.
`fix/table-tab` went on to use D104–D106 for the tabs (merged in D110) and this
branch holds D107–D110, so theirs moved up by seven — D104→D111 … D111→D118 —
in one commit on the branch's own history, every reference included, the
migration's comment among them. A probe confirmed `migrate deploy` — the
production path — does not re-check an applied migration's file, so nothing
changes for a deploy. `migrate dev`, the development path, does: a developer
database that applied the migration under its old comment will report it as
modified and wants a reset (or its `_prisma_migrations` checksum updated) —
most likely only the branch author's. (The same sed had touched a base64
image whose bytes happened to spell "D104"; that file was restored before the
merge.)

**The migration is additive and proven.** `20260908000000_add_kitchen_ticket_in_progress`
adds one enum value with `ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS`; 71 in the
set. An empty database applies all 71 and reads up to date; a database at
`main`'s 27, with a customer-account payment seeded between, applies the
remaining 44, keeps the row, carries the new value, and reads up to date.
`migrate diff` emits only the D44 FK pair on both, as before (O6).

**The floor plan carries both: several tabs, and the badge.** `fix/table-tab`
made a table's sessions a LIST (D104: one link per tab, "Add a tab"); this
branch put a per-device "Food ready" badge on each session (D112, D118: visual
only) — written against the single-session floor. The union keeps the list:
each tab is an `OpenSessionView` with its bumped-ticket ids; an arrangement's
badge counts unanswered bumps across every tab and clears tab by tab as each
tab's link is opened; a physical table still carries one. The Unreserve
control their side still rendered on a held member is not carried — D106
removed it, for the reason it records. Their new render test learned the
tab's name field.

**Everything else is theirs or a union.** The kitchen ticket's tab name (D104)
survives their Preparing/lanes edits to the kitchen service; the orders page
object (D110) survives their filters, counts and cancel; WS-408 keeps the
seeded ticket and matches either write verb ("Start preparing" or "Mark done");
the seed keeps both the 86'd dishes and the tabs; the win32 shell line keeps
its explanation. Route matrix: 290 routes, 202 module-guarded, 88 ungated.
The wizard's validation and character limits ride along without a record of
their own, as the Type column did in D110.

**Tests and the catalogue.** Their branch touched one Playwright test
(WS-408). Nothing else went stale: the labels they renamed are pinned at unit
level (the board's three lanes, the queue's tabs), and the tablet board test
now names the Preparing lane too. Their float ready spec covered one physical
table and no arrangement; the union adds the case it introduced — a joined
table with two tabs, one bumped: one badge on the arrangement, none on its
members, cleared tab by tab. The reopen unit spec gains the Preparing case
(a preparing ticket is not recalled). Their eight records added no catalogue
rows; eleven are added under KIT, POS, OTBL, UI and PROD. Their `migrate
dev` note above, and two comments in the takeaway service that still said
the Sale lands on handover, are corrected.

**What their permissions reach.** The bump bar's Start is gated on
`KITCHEN_STATUS_UPDATE` like completing, so Kitchen staff hold it and the
till's read-only board (D94) does not; the chime, though, is a property of
the screen, not the role — a cashier watching the board hears it. Settle is
`PAYMENT_COLLECT`. Both reach the Salesperson by reference (D108). O7 (the
pager) is unchanged by this merge.

**Two consumers D113 did not visit.** The restaurant dashboard's "Kitchen
queue" tile counted `QUEUED` tickets, which was the whole outstanding set
until Preparing existed; it now counts `OUTSTANDING`, so a kitchen with every
ticket on the stove no longer reads zero. The board's empty Preparing lane
told whoever was looking to "Start a ticket from To make" — the till (D94)
reads the board without that verb; it now reads "Nothing on the stove." The
two D118 silence tripwires (orders queue, tables screen) mocked a chime
module neither screen imports, so a bell rung any other way would have
passed; they now stub the browser's `AudioContext` and assert it is never
constructed, with a positive control that the real chime does construct it.

**Open, for a product decision — O9.** D113 and D117 lean on "the takeaway
workspace's manual stepper" as the escape hatch when the kitchen forgot to
bump. It was deleted with the `/takeaway` cutover (2026-08-10); the drawer
offers handover on READY only. Today the only way to hand over an unbumped
ticket is the API. Refuse, restore a stepper, or offer a confirm-gated "Hand
over anyway" — a decision, not a merge edit.

**Open, for a product decision — O8.** D116 made cancelling the queue's verb
and D117 let payment settle a counter order without handing it over. Where
the two meet, the server's takeaway status write still has no transition
guard — it never did — so a counter order that has been settled and paid can
now be cancelled from the queue with its Sale left PAID and no refund. The
drawer's client-side gate does not cover it either, because a settled order
no longer sits at HANDED_OVER. Not changed in a merge; recorded for a
decision (refuse, or refund).

## 2026-08-28 — Retail template

### D120 — the Retail template returns: clothing first, local inventory, one workspace per shop

**Supersedes D57** on its retail half. PO decision, 2026-08-28.

D57 removed `TILE_SHOP` and `RETAIL` from `BusinessType` on 14 August, on the
finding that the Hardware template and the Tile Shop were the same entity and
that **there was no Retail template**. That was true of the world it was written
in: the enum was ten days old, the three retail values carried zero rows, and no
retail customer existed. *"A transition for ghosts protects nothing."*

What changed is the customer, not the reasoning. A clothing retailer is now in
scope, with grocery behind it, and a template that does not exist cannot serve
them. D57 is superseded on its facts rather than corrected on its logic — the
removal was right, and re-adding is cheap in the direction that matters:
`ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE` is additive, so this record needs none of the
destructive-migration exception D57 had to carve out in
`provider-contract.spec.ts`.

**`RETAIL` returns; `TILE_SHOP` stays removed.** The Tile Shop finding is
untouched — it really is a Hardware workspace, and the pilot tenant remains
classified `HARDWARE`.

#### What a Retail workspace is

A `RETAIL` business type with its own `DomainDescriptor` in
`packages/shared/src/domains/`, registered in `DOMAIN_REGISTRY` — which is total
and has no fallback (D56), so the value cannot exist without the descriptor.

- **Providers:** `InventoryMode.LOCAL` + `AccountingProviderKind.NONE`. Retail
  does not integrate with QuickBooks. This needs no code: both values already
  exist, and D63's quarantine already assumes tenants that never speak to it.
- **Modules:** `SHARED_CORE_MODULES` + `RETAIL_MODULES` **minus `QUICKBOOKS`**.
  `RETAIL_CAPABILITIES` is adopted as-is — it already declares
  `catalogue.variants` and `collections` true, `fulfilment.kind: IMMEDIATE`,
  `channels: ['COUNTER']`.
- **Navigation and permissions** follow D93: a rail entry is gated on what the
  screen can do. A retail till legitimately holds `SALE_CREATE`; nothing may use
  it as a proxy for anything else.
- **Catalogue fields** arrive through `catalogue.attributeSchema` (D64) —
  description in `attributes`, behaviour in columns. Clothing and grocery each
  declare their own; neither adds a migration.

#### One workspace per shop

**A Retail workspace serves exactly one shop, with one branch.** A chain of three
shops is three workspaces.

This is a deliberate acceptance of an existing limit rather than a design
preference. `LocalInventoryProvider` counts a tenant's active branches and
**refuses every stock operation when there is more than one** — the guard D10
describes as protecting against a shared `Product.quantityOnHand` being
decremented by two shops at once. D10 calls that *"a known architectural defect …
not an acceptable permanent limitation"* and schedules the fix as Phase 2.5.
**That fix is not a retail dependency and is not being brought forward.** With one
branch per workspace the guard is never reached.

What the model gives up, recorded so nobody discovers it in front of a customer:
stock, catalogue, customers and reporting are per shop; there is no cross-shop
lookup, no transfer, and no consolidated head-office view. The product-import
path makes seeding a second shop practical. The first customer who needs one
number across two shops reopens D10 Phase 2.5.

#### The sellable unit is the variant

Retail sells a size, a pack, a weight — not a style. `ProductVariant` and its
dimensions already exist, `SaleItem.productVariantId` is already nullable with SKU
and name snapshots (D44), and goods receipts already write per-variant stock into
`BranchInventory`.

**The sell path does not.** It aggregates cart lines by `productId` and decrements
the global `Product.quantityOnHand`, so selling a Medium reduces a shared "shirts"
number and leaves the Medium count untouched. Per-variant stock accuracy is a
requirement of this template, and closing that gap is the first implementation
phase.

Two properties carry forward unchanged: the conditional stock write that prevents
two tills selling the same last unit — moved, never reimplemented — and the
`trackInventory` check that keeps non-stocked lines moving no stock.

#### Tax

Per **category** and **global**, resolved most-specific-first, with
`Product.taxable` honoured as an exemption and the resolved rate **snapshotted
onto the sale line** so a rate change cannot rewrite an old receipt — the same
reasoning D44 applies to variant names.

**No price bands.** Considered and rejected: the band-boundary behaviour is
visible to a shopper whenever a discounted item crosses one, and no confirmed
format needs them.

Prices are **displayed tax-inclusive**. Storage is unchanged — net, tax and gross
stay separate; only presentation changes. The inclusive figure is never stored as
the price, because converting it back to net drifts by a cent at some quantities
and the receipt would then disagree with the ledger. This finally gives
`AppSettings.taxInclusive` a meaning; it has been persisted and read by nothing.

Per-line tax replaces the single order-level figure. D8's requirement that tax
treatment stay tenant-configurable is unaffected.

#### Formats

**Clothing and grocery are the confirmed formats. The clothing pilot ships
first.** Scales and weighed goods are grocery-only and are not on the clothing
path.

Further retail formats — pharmacy, electronics — are added as a descriptor and a
seed pack, never as code. If a third format requires a new table, a DTO change or
a branch in a service, the mechanism has failed and the mechanism is what gets
fixed. The one legitimate exception is a format needing genuinely new *behaviour*,
which is a feature with its own record, gated by a capability.

#### Billing audit: A4 and A8 only

Of the five open items in `hardcoded-audit.md`, the retail work claims **two**:

- **A4** — promotions are surfaced by the POS catalogue and never applied at
  close. Retail needs working promotions, and the fix lives in a new applier plus
  the retail sale path.
- **A8** — reports coerce `Decimal` to float and back, so totals cannot tie to the
  payment ledger. This is fixed **before** retail reporting is built on the same
  code, not after.

**A2, A3 and A7 are deliberately not claimed here.** They are restaurant-side
defects, they contribute nothing to the clothing pilot, and they live in files
another developer is modifying daily. Ownership of those three is unresolved at
the time of writing; if they return to this work, that is a separate record
appended later rather than an edit to this one.

**A4 is larger than "wire up the existing service".** `PromotionsService` is CRUD
only and the evaluator exports one function answering whether a promotion is
inside its schedule window. There is no discount calculation anywhere; it must be
built.

#### Discounts do not stack

**A manual line discount overrides any promotion on that line.** Manual discounts
carry role-based approval limits; a promotion stacking on top would take the total
past a figure nobody approved, and the approval would be for one number while the
customer paid another.

`stackable` continues to govern promotion-against-promotion. The override is per
line, not per basket.

#### Not in scope

QuickBooks for retail tenants · multi-branch inventory, transfers and branch
management · price-band tax · schema-per-tenant · migrating Simply POS data,
which is a reference implementation only.

`ModuleKey.EXCHANGES` remains as D2 left it — a reserved key with an A4 document
renderer and no transaction. The retail template builds that transaction; until it
lands, D2's instruction stands and exchange behaviour must not be represented as
implemented.

> **Superseded 2026-09-07 by [D128b](#d107b).** The transaction landed in Phase 7.
> The caveat is lifted; read D128b for what "implemented" does and does not mean.

## 2026-08-31 — Stock authority for a product with variants

### D121 — stock is tracked by variant id, not product id

**Direction (supervisor, 2026-08-31):** *"Stock should be tracked by product variant
id, not product id."*

`BranchInventory` already keys on `(branch, product, variant?)` per D44, and both the
write path (1a) and the per-variant read (1b.1) obeyed this. The **item-level read**
did not: `sellable.service` set `availableQuantity` and `stockState` from
`Product.quantityOnHand`.

That column is the D10 rollup mirror. It is maintained on sale and receipt, so it is
not abandoned — but it is a mirror, and it can drift. It was observed reading
`350.000` for a product whose four variants held 22 units between them, and the till
showed the 350.

**Decided.** For a product with `hasVariants` and at least one active variant, the
item level is **derived from the variant rows**:

- `availableQuantity` — the **sum** across sizes. Deliberately not `null` as `sku` and
  `unitPrice` are for a variant parent: those are null because using them would be
  *wrong* (a sale at the parent price is a financial error, a parent-SKU scan is
  ambiguous), whereas a total misleads nobody once nothing caps by it. The sell cap is
  `stockCap(product, variant)`, which asks the chosen size.
- `stockState` — `OUT` only when every size is out; `LOW` when no size is `IN_STOCK`,
  each size measured against **its own** reorder point.

`Product.quantityOnHand` keeps its D10 role for variant-less products and QuickBooks
caching, and is still mirrored on write. It is simply **not read** for a product that
has variants.

The derivation lives on the **server** (`aggregateVariantStock`, beside `stockStateFor`
in `common/stock-state.ts`), not in the till. D31 makes the server the authority, and
the alternative put the same rule in `pos-retail-checkout` and `quotation-builder` —
two copies of one threshold rule, which is how two screens come to disagree.

Not gated on `capabilities.catalogue.variants`: that capability governs whether a
client is *shown* the sizes. How much stock exists is not a display question.

No migration. Read-model behaviour only.

## 2026-09-01 — Applying the RETAIL enum migration

### D120a — `RETAIL` is added in its own migration, and used in a later one

**D120 already authorises this migration.** It says in terms that
`ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE` is additive and that the record "needs none of the
destructive-migration exception D57 had to carve out". Nothing here re-authorises
it. This entry records **how** it must be applied, because getting that wrong
fails at apply time rather than at review.

#### The constraint

PostgreSQL is 16.14. Since PG 12, `ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE` may run inside a
transaction block — but **the new value cannot be used in the same transaction
that adds it**. Prisma wraps each migration in a transaction, so a single
migration that adds `RETAIL` and then references it (a seed, a backfill, a
`DEFAULT`, a check constraint, a partial index predicate) fails with
*"unsafe use of new value of enum type"*.

The failure is not a data risk — the transaction rolls back — but it strands a
migration in a failed state that every developer then has to resolve by hand.

#### Decided

**Two migrations, in order:**

1. **`add_retail_business_type`** — `ALTER TYPE "BusinessType" ADD VALUE 'RETAIL';`
   and nothing else. No seed, no backfill, no constraint mentioning the value.
2. **Anything that uses `RETAIL`** — a separate, later migration.

**Written with `IF NOT EXISTS`**, following the closest precedent in this repo —
the D44 variants migration (`20260812000000`), which uses
`ALTER TYPE "StockMovementReason" ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'RECEIPT'`. The older
auto-generated form (`20260709145818`, `PaymentMethod` → `'QR_PAYMENT'`) omits
it. Both work; the explicit form is chosen because it is re-runnable against a
database where the value already exists, which is the state a developer lands in
after a partially-resolved migration.

Verified on the project's own PostgreSQL 16.14 rather than assumed:

```
BEGIN; ALTER TYPE t ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'B'; INSERT INTO … VALUES ('B'); COMMIT;
  ERROR:  unsafe use of new value "B" of enum type
  HINT:   New enum values must be committed before they can be used.

-- split across two transactions: succeeds
-- re-running the ADD VALUE:  NOTICE: enum label "B" already exists, skipping
```

#### Ordering within the enum

`RETAIL` is appended, not positioned with `BEFORE`/`AFTER`. Enum ordinal order is
not a display order anywhere in this codebase — the console picker sorts by
`DomainDescriptor.template.order` (D55), and `BUSINESS_TYPE_VALUES` is used for
validation messages, not ranking. Appending keeps the migration a pure addition.

#### What this does not do

Adding the value **puts no card in the console picker** and creates no template.
`WORKSPACE_TEMPLATES` filters `DOMAIN_REGISTRY` through the hand-maintained
`OFFERED_TEMPLATE_KEYS` allowlist, and `DOMAIN_REGISTRY` is total over
`BusinessType` — so the enum value without a descriptor is a **compile error**,
by design (D56).

Practical consequence: the migration and the descriptor land together or the
build breaks. That is the intended pressure, not an obstacle to work around.

## 2026-09-02 — Phase 3 tax: scope, and backwards compatibility

### D122 — per-line tax snapshots; per-category rates wait for grocery

Tech Lead, 2026-09-02. Supersedes nothing; narrows the Phase 3 scope D120
authorised.

#### What D120 said, and what changed

D120 authorises "per-category and global tax, no price bands, displayed
tax-inclusive". Building it was scoped as `TaxRate` and `TaxRule` tables with a
resolution hierarchy.

Two facts, established by reading the code rather than the plan:

1. **The flat-rate engine already works for retail.** `computeDocumentTotals` is
   shared by sales, quotations and restaurant (D59). Setting a tenant rate on a
   clothing workspace and selling produced `1,850 → 333 tax → 2,183` with no code
   written.
2. **Per-category rates are a grocery requirement, not a clothing one.** Zero-rated
   staples beside standard-rated goods is what forces a hierarchy. Clothing is
   uniformly standard-rated, and grocery is parked pending a customer (open
   decision 12).

#### Decided — option B

Phase 3 narrows to what the clothing pilot needs and what is correct regardless:

- **No `TaxRate` / `TaxRule` tables.** The flat rate stays.
- **Three additive columns** (below).
- **Returns stop prorating** and read the per-line snapshot.
- **Receipts show a tax breakdown.**

Per-category resolution moves to sit **with grocery**, where the requirement
lives. It stays cheap to add later: the columns below are the hard part, and a
resolution service writes into them.

The deciding argument is not effort. Building a rate hierarchy means surgery on
the one engine all three templates share, for a capability the clothing pilot
cannot demonstrate — and this branch has just spent a day proving it does not
break the restaurant and hardware teams (2.15). Guessing at a grocer's categories
before a grocer exists is the same mistake refused for grocery attributes.

#### The three columns

| Table | Column | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `Product` | `taxable` | `Boolean @default(true)` |
| `SaleItem` | `taxRatePercent` | `Decimal? @db.Decimal(5, 2)` |
| `ReturnItem` | `taxRatePercent` | `Decimal? @db.Decimal(5, 2)` |

No new tables, no enum, no backfill. One migration — **D120a's two-migration rule
does not apply**, being scoped to `ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE`, and nothing here adds
an enum value.

#### Why `taxable` defaults to TRUE

**Because it is already true of every product in the system.** There is no
per-product exemption anywhere today; tax is one rate on the whole bill, so every
product is taxed. The column writes down the existing fact rather than changing
it.

A default of `false` would assert that every product in every tenant is exempt.
The moment anything read it, a restaurant selling a Rs 2,000 meal would charge
**Rs 0 tax instead of Rs 360** — silently, across every tenant.

The name misleads, which is why this is recorded: `taxable = true` reads as
*turning tax on*. It means *this product is subject to whatever rate the tenant
has configured*, which for a tenant configured at 0% is still zero.

In the first step neither default changes behaviour, because nothing reads the
column. `true` matters later, and later it means "carry on exactly as before".

#### Why the rate snapshots are NULL, not 0.00

**`0.00` means zero-rated. `NULL` means no rate was recorded.** They are different
facts and the distinction is load-bearing.

Defaulting to `0.00` would claim every historical sale was zero-rated, and a
return against one would refund no tax at all. With `NULL`, the returns path reads
"this line predates per-line tax" and falls back to today's proportional method —
so **every existing sale keeps refunding exactly as it does now**.

This follows `RestaurantBranchConfig.taxRatePercent`, nullable for the same stated
reason: *"0 is a meaningful rate and must be distinguishable from unset"*.

#### Why returns must stop prorating

`returns.calc.ts` refunds tax as `saleTax × (line's share of the taxable base)`.
That is correct **only** while one rate covers the whole bill, and its own comment
says so: *"Tax was a flat rate on the sale's taxable base."*

The moment rates differ per line it is wrong:

> Rice (0%, Rs 1,000) and soap (18%, Rs 1,000). Total tax Rs 180. The customer
> returns the rice. Proration refunds `180 × (1000/2000)` = **Rs 90 of tax on a
> zero-rated item.**

`SaleItem.taxRatePercent` is what makes the correct answer reachable, and
`ReturnItem.taxRatePercent` records what was reversed so a credit note is
self-contained and a later rate change cannot alter a past refund. Copied from the
sale line, never re-resolved — the rule 1a.20 established for variants.

#### Backwards compatibility

Nothing reads the new columns in the schema step. It ships **inert**, the pattern
`RestaurantBranchConfig.taxRatePercent` used: *"No UI yet, deliberately; the column
and fallback ship first."*

| Domain | Effect |
|---|---|
| Restaurant | none — `taxable` true is today's behaviour, rate columns null and unread |
| Hardware | none |
| Retail | none until the resolution logic lands |

### D123 — promotions allocate per line, frozen at sale time

Tech Lead, 2026-09-03. Supersedes nothing; scopes Phase 4 (audit item **A4**).

#### The question

Phase 4 builds the discount engine — the models, the four types and the schedule
exist, but nothing turns a promotion into money. Before writing the applier, one
question had to be answered: **where does a promotion discount live**, and how is
it reversed when part of the sale comes back?

Two candidates. Bake it into the line, the way a manual discount already works;
or hold it as an order-level figure with its own proportional allocation, the way
the storewide order discount works.

#### Decided — per line, baked into `lineTotal`, frozen at sale time

A promotion reduces the line it applies to. The amount is computed **once, when
the sale is written**, and never re-derived afterwards. A return reverses it by
the same `× frac` scaling the per-line manual discount already uses.

**Returns allocate; they do not re-evaluate.** Returning one item of a "2 for 1"
does not recompute the basket as though the promotion never qualified. This
follows D122's returns rule directly — *"allocation, not recomputation: a return
can never refund a different amount of tax than the sale charged"* — and extends
it from tax to promotions.

#### Why not the order-level shape — the argument that decided it

Two shirts at 1,000 and a tie at 500, tie free under buy-two-get-one. The
customer pays **2,000** and returns the tie.

Allocating the 500 saving order-wide by line value gives the tie a weight of 500
against the shirts' 2,000, so the tie absorbs 100 of it:

    refund = 500 (its subtotal) − 100 (its share) = 400

**Rs 400 refunded on an item the customer paid nothing for.**

That is the same defect D122's `3.11` removed — refunding tax on a zero-rated
line — with the same cause: a basket-wide proportional allocation applied to a
saving that was never basket-wide. A BOGO discount belongs to the free *item*,
not to the basket by value.

Per line, the tie carries `promotionDiscountAmount = 500` and `lineTotal = 0`, so
the refund is `500 − 500 = 0`. Correct, with no special case.

#### Composition order

    unit price × quantity
      → line discount   (manual OR promotion — never both, see the invariant)
      → order discount  (computed on the subtotal AFTER the above)
      → tax             (on the base narrowed by `Product.taxable`, D122)

A promotion therefore **does** reduce the base a storewide order discount is
computed against. This needs no new logic: `sales.service` already resolves the
order discount against `subtotal − totalDiscount`, so a promotion inside that
rollup is inside the base by construction.

#### The invariant: manual and promotion are mutually exclusive per line

A manual line discount **overrides** any promotion on that line, so at most one of
`discountAmount` and `promotionDiscountAmount` is non-zero on any line. Enforced
in the applier and pinned by test, not by a database constraint — the repository
uses neither CHECK constraints nor triggers, and a rule that lives in one place in
code is easier to prove than one split across both.

Why manual wins: a cashier discounting is acting deliberately, usually under a
role-based approval limit the system enforces. An automatic promotion stacking on
top would push the total past a figure nobody approved.

#### Bundle allocation

`BUNDLE_FIXED_PRICE` spans lines, so its saving is distributed **proportionally to
gross line value, with the largest-remainder method for the final cent**. The
distribution happens inside the applier, once, at sale time, and is then frozen —
so the printed rows sum to the printed total and a later reader never re-divides
it differently.

This is the same reasoning that put the tax breakdown's remainder on the largest
row rather than letting four renderers each round independently.

#### The four columns

| Table | Column | Type |
|---|---|---|
| `SaleItem` | `promotionDiscountAmount` | `Decimal @default(0) @db.Decimal(12, 2)` |
| `SaleItem` | `promotionId` | `String?` |
| `SaleItem` | `promotionNameSnapshot` | `String?` |
| `ReturnItem` | `promotionDiscountAdjustment` | `Decimal @default(0) @db.Decimal(12, 2)` |

All additive, all defaulted or nullable, no backfill, no table rewrite. They ship
**inert** — nothing reads them until the applier lands.

`promotionNameSnapshot` exists because a promotion can be renamed or deleted after
the sale, and a reprinted receipt must still name what the customer was given.
That is D44's snapshot rule applied unchanged.

**`promotionDiscountAmount` is a mirror, not the authority.** `lineTotal` is
already net of it and is what tax and returns read. The column exists so a
promotion is separately reportable in Phase 8 without a second source of truth —
the same relationship D121 records between `Product.quantityOnHand` and the
per-variant rows.

#### What this buys with no further work

- **Tax follows automatically.** `taxableBase` reads `lineTotal` (D122, 3.14), so
  a promoted line is taxed on what the customer actually pays.
- **The returns denominator stays correct.** `computeReturnLine` derives its
  order-discount base from `sale.subtotal − sale.totalDiscount`, and the promotion
  is inside `totalDiscount`.
- **The till and the server agree**, provided the applier lives in
  `@hardware-pos/shared` and both call it — the rule 3.14 was written to enforce.

#### What this deliberately does not solve

**Bundle breaking.** Return one shirt from a buy-two-get-one and the customer
keeps a free tie, having paid for one shirt. The shop absorbs the difference.

Re-evaluating the basket would recover it, but the refund would then depend on the
order items came back in, could be zero, and could produce a debt — a customer
being told they owe money on a return. We take the loss by default. If the
business wants protection it must be an **explicit rule an operator can see** —
refusing or flagging a partial return that breaks a bundle — never a silent
recomputation.

#### Restaurant impact: none

`ProjectedSaleItem` carries only the fields it lists, so restaurant settlements
write none of these columns and take the defaults — the same mechanism that leaves
`taxRatePercent` null there (3.16). Additive and nullable only; no reader may
assume non-null on `SaleItem`.

---

### D124 — `PROMOTIONS` is its own module key

Tech Lead, 2026-09-03. Corrects the D45 hotfix; unblocks Phase 4 for retail.

#### What was wrong

`/promotions` was gated on `MENU_MANAGEMENT`, a **food-service** module. A retail
tenant has no such module, so the Promotions screen answered **"Feature not
available"** — after Phase 4 had built the entire discount engine behind it.

The controller predicted this in its own docblock:

> Gated on `INVENTORY` because … `INVENTORY` is the one module that BOTH
> Restaurant and Retail tenants carry by default. **Restaurant-only modules like
> `MENU_MANAGEMENT` would refuse Retail's later use of promotions.**

A later "D45 hotfix" changed the gate to `MENU_MANAGEMENT` anyway, because
restaurant tenants turned out **not** to carry `INVENTORY`. The hotfix fixed food
service and caused exactly the failure the docblock warned about. Phase 4 is
"Retail's later use of promotions".

#### Why neither existing module works

Verified against the module sets rather than assumed:

| Set | Members |
|---|---|
| `SHARED_CORE_MODULES` | `CUSTOMERS` `REPORTING` `USERS` `BRANCHES` `SETTINGS` `BRANDING` |
| `RETAIL_MODULES` | `RETAIL_POS` `INVENTORY` `QUOTATIONS` `RETURNS` `EXCHANGES` `SUPPLIERS` `QUICKBOOKS` |
| `FOOD_SERVICE_MODULES` | `MENU_MANAGEMENT` `DINING` `TABLE_MANAGEMENT` `TAKEAWAY` `KITCHEN` `RESERVATIONS` |

`INVENTORY` is retail-only. `MENU_MANAGEMENT` is food-service-only. **No module
common to both governs a catalogue admin surface**, so every choice among the
existing keys refuses one tenant type. Accepting either module would encode the
confusion rather than resolve it, and would leave the next reader unable to say
what actually gates the screen.

#### Decided

**A dedicated `PROMOTIONS` module key**, in both default sets.

Promotions are not a food-service feature that retail borrows, nor an inventory
feature: they are their own admin surface that both templates own. The key says
so, and a gate that names the thing it protects needs no comment explaining why
it names something else.

| Change | Where |
|---|---|
| `PROMOTIONS` added to the `ModuleKey` enum | `schema.prisma` + migration |
| …and to `MODULE_KEY_VALUES` | `packages/shared/src/types/platform.ts` |
| Added to `FOOD_SERVICE_MODULES` | `domains/modules.ts` |
| Declared on the RETAIL descriptor, **not** on `RETAIL_MODULES` | `domains/retail.domain.ts` |
| `@RequireModule(ModuleKey.PROMOTIONS)` | `promotions.controller.ts` |

#### Why retail declares it and food service does not

`HARDWARE` composes its default set from `RETAIL_MODULES`, and
`platform.constants.spec` pins that set as **byte-equal to
`LEGACY_TENANT_DEFAULTS`** — the modules a tenant with no business profile falls
back to. Adding `PROMOTIONS` there would silently widen another team's template
and the legacy fallback with it, so the RETAIL descriptor declares the module
instead and `RETAIL_MODULES` is untouched.

`FOOD_SERVICE_MODULES` has no such equality test and food service **must** gain
the key, because regating the controller would otherwise take away a screen they
have today.

**Hardware is left as it was, deliberately.** It never had a working Promotions
screen either — the D45 hotfix gated it on `MENU_MANAGEMENT`, which hardware also
lacks — so this changes nothing for them. Whether they want it is theirs to
decide; a `TenantModule` row enables it per tenant in the meantime.

#### No backfill, and no tenant loses the screen

`resolveModules` composes the default set for the business type and **adds**
explicitly-enabled rows; an explicit row only ever wins as a *revocation*. Its own
docblock states the consequence: *"a tenant created before a new module shipped
picks it up without a data migration."*

Checked against live data rather than trusted: of five tenants, four carry no
`TenantModule` rows at all and one carries twelve. All five gain `PROMOTIONS`
from the default set, because none of them has an explicit `isEnabled: false` for
a key that did not exist until now.

#### Migration shape

One statement, `ALTER TYPE "ModuleKey" ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'PROMOTIONS'`.
D120a's two-migration rule is about **using** a new enum label in the transaction
that adds it; nothing here writes a row with the new value, so one migration is
correct. `IF NOT EXISTS` follows the D44 and D120a precedent.

#### What this does not change

Food service keeps its promotions screen — it gains `PROMOTIONS` in the same
change, so the hotfix's fix is preserved rather than reverted. No route, screen or
permission moves; only the module that names the gate.

## D126 — a cart-level promotion is an order discount, not a line discount

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-04. Supersedes nothing. Extends D123.

### The requirement

`FIXED_AMOUNT_DISCOUNT` could only ever mean *"Rs 1,000 off these products"*:
`validateTypeShape` demanded at least one `BUY` item, and `applyFixedAmount`
spread `amountOff` across those products' lines. The requirement is the other
reading — *"Rs 1,000 off the cart once it reaches Rs 10,000"* — which the model
could not express at all. There was no threshold column, and no way to say
"applies to the whole basket".

### The decision

Two shapes of the same promotion type, told apart by whether it names products:

| `items` | Meaning | Where the discount lands |
|---|---|---|
| non-empty | *"Rs X off these products"* — unchanged | the participating **lines** |
| **empty** | *"Rs X off the cart"* — new | the **order** |

`Promotion.minimumSpend` is the threshold. NULL means none, which is what every
row predating this decision means, so the backfill is to do nothing.

### Why the order level, and not `SaleItem`

`SaleItem` holds a single `promotionId` (D123). A cart-level promotion has to
coexist with the line-level promotions that already claimed those lines, so
allocating it onto lines would either need a second promotion column per line or
would displace a line promotion that is already correct.

The order level already solves this exact problem for the **manual** order
discount — `Sale.orderDiscountAmount` with `Return.orderDiscountAdjustment`
allocating it back on a refund. A cart-level promotion is the same shape, so it
gets the same treatment rather than a new mechanism:

```
Sale.promotionOrderDiscountAmount   +  promotionOrderId  +  promotionOrderNameSnapshot
Return.promotionOrderDiscountAdjustment
```

Kept **separate** from the manual columns rather than folded into them: a refund
has to be able to say which part of a discount was the cashier's decision and
which was automatic, and `orderDiscountApprovedById` beside the manual figure
means something that would be a lie next to a promotion.

Like D123's line columns, `promotionOrderId` carries **no foreign key** and the
name is snapshotted, so deleting a promotion never rewrites a document that has
already been sold.

### At most one cart-level promotion per sale

There is one set of columns, so the applier picks the single best eligible
cart-level candidate. This is a real limit, stated rather than hidden: a second
concurrent cart-level promotion would need a child table and its own decision.
Line-level promotions are unaffected — any number still apply, one per line.

### What the threshold measures

The **eligible net amount**: line subtotals less any line-level promotion, summed
over lines that carry no manual discount.

- *Net, not gross* — the threshold is compared against the money this discount
  would actually reduce. Measuring gross would let a heavily discounted basket
  clear a threshold it no longer reaches.
- *Excluding manually discounted lines* — D123 already makes such a line
  invisible to promotions. A threshold that counted it would be counting money
  no promotion is allowed to touch.

The discount is capped at that same amount, so a cart-level promotion can never
drive an order below zero.

### Evaluation order

Line-level promotions resolve first, then the cart-level pass runs against what
they left. That is what makes the threshold well-defined, and it is why a
cart-level promotion is **never discarded because a line was claimed** — it does
not compete for lines at all.

Basket exclusivity (4.4) still governs it: a non-stackable promotion that has
taken the basket blocks the cart-level pass too, and a non-stackable cart-level
promotion will not join something already applied.

### Tax is not touched

Confirmed with the PO. The cart-level discount reduces the order total **after**
tax is computed on the line totals, exactly as the manual order discount has
always done (3.14). `Rs 12,600 → Rs 1,000 off → Rs 11,600`. No tax-base change,
no new tax path, one code path for both order-level discounts.

### A cart-level promotion never requires a promotional product

`rewardEntitlements` only produces an entitlement for a rule carrying a `GET`
item, and `buyXGetYOutcome` returns null for any type other than `BUY_X_GET_Y`.
So `FIXED_AMOUNT_DISCOUNT` — either shape — cannot create an outstanding reward
and cannot block payment. That was already true and is now pinned by test.

### BOGO qualifying units are not consumed

Also confirmed with the PO, and recorded here because it was previously implicit.
`applyBuyXGetY` claims only its **reward** lines; the BUY units that earned the
reward stay available to other stackable promotions. Two shirts may take a
percentage discount *and* earn a free tie.

The consequence is deliberate and worth stating plainly: a unit can be counted by
more than one promotion — a shirt inside a bundle can also count toward a BOGO
threshold. That is the intended generosity, not an accounting error; each line
still carries exactly one promotion, so every figure remains persistable and
refundable.

## D125 — the option library, SKU generation, and what to do about the barcodes

**Status:** proposed, 2026-09-04. Covers Phase 5 steps 1-4. Blocks `5.1`.

Every figure below was measured against the pilot database on 2026-09-04, not
estimated. The catalogue is small (6 retail products, 48 variants), which makes
the findings *more* alarming rather than less: the drift the plan predicted at 400
products is already present at six.

---

### Part 1 — A tenant-level option library, ADDED BESIDE the per-product dimensions

#### The evidence

`ProductVariationDimension` is keyed `@@unique([productId, name])` — a dimension
belongs to one product. With six products the catalogue already contains:

| Dimension name | Products defining it separately |
|---|---|
| `Colour` | 4 |
| `Color` | 1 |
| `Size` | 6 |

Two spellings of one concept, and `Size` defined six times over five different
option sets (`1-4 inch`, `30/32/34/36`, `S/M/L/XL`, `XS/M/L`, `13½/15½`). Worse,
`Colour :: Black/Blue/Red` and `Color :: Black/Blue/Red` are the *same set*
spelled two ways. Nothing in the model can see that they are the same, so nothing
can group by colour, filter by size, or generate a stable SKU segment.

#### The decision

Introduce `AttributeDefinition` and `AttributeOption`, scoped to the **tenant**:

    AttributeDefinition   (tenantId, name)        unique per tenant
    AttributeOption       (definitionId, code)    unique within a definition
                          + `name`, `position`

and give the existing per-product rows an OPTIONAL link to them:

    ProductVariationDimension.attributeDefinitionId  String?
    ProductVariationOption.attributeOptionId         String?

**Additive, not a promotion of the existing tables.** The alternative — moving
`ProductVariationDimension` to tenant scope by dropping `productId` — rewrites the
key that `ProductVariantOptionValue` already points at, on live variant data, and
would have to run in the same migration as the backfill. This way the library can
be populated, reviewed and corrected by an operator *before* anything depends on
it, and a product that never adopts it keeps working exactly as it does now.

**`code` lives on the option, not the dimension.** It is what SKU generation
consumes (`BLK`, `30`, `XL`), and it is the reason the library exists at all:
`Colour/Black` and `Color/Black` cannot produce one SKU segment while they are two
unrelated rows.

**Migration of existing data is a UI task, not a SQL task.** Eleven dimension rows
across two tenants is small enough for an operator to map by hand, and the
`Colour`/`Color` decision is a judgement nobody should make in a migration script.
The link column stays nullable so the mapping can be done incrementally.

---

### Part 2 — SKU generation reuses `DocumentSequence`

#### The decision

`<CATEGORY>-<SEQ>[-<OPTION CODE>…]`, generated by default and overridable, unique
per tenant. The sequence comes from the existing `DocumentSequence` table with a
new `docType` of `SKU`:

    DocumentSequence  @@id([tenantId, docType])
    nextDocumentNumber(tx, tenantId, 'SKU')   -- INSERT … ON CONFLICT … RETURNING

**No new table and no new concurrency design.** That function is already the
repository's answer to "two tills allocate a number at the same moment", proven by
sale, return, quotation, table-session and restaurant-order numbering. Inventing a
second mechanism for SKUs would be a second thing to get wrong.

**Gaps are accepted.** `nextDocumentNumber` increments inside the transaction, so a
rolled-back product creation burns a number. A gap-free sequence would need a lock
held across the whole create, which is exactly the contention the existing design
avoids. A SKU is an identifier, not an audit trail; nobody counts them.

**Uniqueness is already enforced.** `ProductVariant.sku` carries
`@@unique([tenantId, sku])` today, so a generated SKU that collides with a
hand-typed one fails at the database rather than silently duplicating. Generation
retries on collision rather than assuming the sequence is enough.

---

### Part 3 — Barcodes: the constraint is safe, the existing values are not

#### Measured, not assumed

    48 variants   20 with a barcode   28 null   0 empty strings
    duplicates within a tenant:  NONE
    duplicates across tenants:   NONE
    every barcode: 13 digits, numeric, prefix 2001 or 2990

So `@@unique([tenantId, barcode])` can be added **cleanly, with no remediation
step and no backfill**. That was the open question blocking this record, and the
answer is that there is nothing to clean up.

#### The finding that was not expected

**18 of the 20 existing barcodes have an invalid EAN-13 check digit.**

The algorithm was verified against four published EAN-13 codes and three
deliberately corrupted ones before this was believed.

    2001000000015   INVALID   BRSH-1IN
    2001000000022   INVALID   BRSH-2IN-V
    2990001000000   INVALID   TSHIRT-S-BLACK
    2990001000001   valid     TSHIRT-S-WHITE   <- valid by coincidence

The two that pass do so by accident: a sequential counter lands on the correct
check digit about one time in ten. There are two different generators here
(`2001…` and `2990…`), and neither computes a check digit.

**Why it matters.** These are 13 numeric digits beginning with `2`, which is the
GS1 range reserved for in-store use — so the *prefix* choice is right. But any
scanner or label renderer that validates the check digit will reject them, and a
`EAN-13` barcode image cannot even be rendered from an invalid payload. Phase 5
step 5 renders labels as `CODE128 / EAN-13`; that step would have failed on 18 of
20 rows, and the cause would have looked like a rendering bug.

#### The decision

1. **Generate barcodes with a correct EAN-13 check digit**, from
   `nextDocumentNumber(tx, tenantId, 'BARCODE')` plus a per-tenant prefix.
2. **A configurable prefix map per tenant**, set during workspace setup. The plan
   already records the sequencing constraint — *configured before any allocation,
   or the tenant reprints every label* — and this record adopts it as binding.
3. **Reissue the 18 invalid codes.** They are unprinted pilot data: 20 variants
   across two development tenants, nothing in a customer's hands. The cost is a
   backfill script now versus a label reprint later.
4. **Validate on write.** A barcode that is 13 numeric digits must carry a correct
   check digit, refused at the DTO. Supplier barcodes that are genuinely not
   EAN-13 (CODE128 alphanumerics) are accepted as-is — the rule keys on shape, not
   on origin, so it cannot reject a valid supplier code.

**Supplier vs internal stays a flag, not a separate column.** A variant carries one
barcode; where it came from is provenance. `barcodeSource: SUPPLIER | INTERNAL`
answers "may I regenerate this?", which is the only question the system actually
asks of it.

---

### What this does not decide

- **Label geometry** (step 6) — the settings blob is JSON and already scoped
  `(tenantId, branchId)`, so it needs no migration and no decision.
- **Label rendering** (step 5) — a new `PrintJobType` on the existing queue. Blocked
  on Part 3 being done first, for the reason above.
- **Whether `Colour` or `Color` wins.** An operator's call, made in the UI.

## D125a — two nullable columns D125 did not model: `categoryId` and `swatchHex`

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. Extends [D125](#d104), supersedes nothing.
Ships with the `5.1` migration.

D125 modelled `AttributeDefinition (tenantId, name)` and
`AttributeOption (definitionId, code, name, position)`. Two requirements that
are already written down elsewhere have no home in that shape, and both cost
nothing today and a migration over live variant data later.

### 1. `AttributeDefinition.categoryId String?` — bind a scale to a category

`04-format-packs.md` §3 is explicit: *"Bind scales to categories so Footwear
offers 24–46 and Apparel offers XS–XXXL. This is the one idea worth taking from
Simply POS, and it is what makes a 400-product catalogue tractable."*
`PROGRESS.md` carries it into the step itself — `5.1` reads *"tenant-level
attribute/option library, **category-bound**"*. D125's model has no category,
so the requirement had nowhere to be written.

**Nullable, and a BINDING HINT rather than identity.** An unbound definition
(`Colour`) applies to every category; a bound one (`Size — footwear`) is what
the picker offers under Footwear. The hint narrows what a screen suggests; it
never decides what is legal, so a product may still adopt any definition.

**`categoryId` is deliberately NOT in the unique key.** `@@unique([tenantId,
name])` stands exactly as D125 wrote it. Adding the category would look more
correct and would be wrong: Postgres treats NULLs as distinct in a unique
index, so `(tenantId, NULL, 'Size')` is insertable twice and the library
silently re-acquires the duplication it exists to remove. Two scales therefore
carry two names — which is how `04-format-packs` §3 already writes them, in the
same table that asked for the binding.

**`ON DELETE SET NULL`.** Deleting a category unbinds its scales; it does not
delete a library other categories may also be using. Cascade here would let a
routine category tidy-up destroy the `Size` scale every apparel product points
at.

### 2. `AttributeOption.swatchHex String?` — the colour picker's swatch

`04-format-packs.md` §3 asks for it by name: *"Colour — named values with a
swatch. `swatchHex` for the picker."*

**Nullable, because only a colour scale has one** — `Size :: XL` has no colour —
and because a colour with no swatch yet is still a usable option. `#RRGGBB`,
validated at the DTO against a shared pure function so the server's rule and
the form's live preview cannot drift apart, which is the `4.15` / `4.21` /
`4.22` failure this phase is explicitly guarding against.

**A hex string, not a named palette.** A palette would be a third table to
seed, migrate and localise, and it would still have to answer "what if the
shop's teal is not our teal". The picker needs a colour to draw; the shop
already knows which one.

### Why both now rather than when they are consumed

Neither field has a consumer in `5.1`. Both are added anyway, because the
alternative is a second migration over `AttributeOption` rows that products,
variants and generated SKUs will by then depend on. Two nullable columns in a
table that is empty on the day it ships cost one line of SQL each; the same two
columns after `5.3` cost a coordinated deploy. This is the same reasoning D123
used to ship `4.1`'s four columns inert, three steps before anything wrote to
them.

### What this does not change

- **D125 stands unamended.** The additive shape, the nullable links, the
  `DocumentSequence` decision for SKUs, and all three barcode findings are
  untouched. D125a adds two columns to the tables D125 defined.
- **Whether `Colour` or `Color` wins** is still an operator's call in the UI.
- **Category binding is not enforcement.** Nothing refuses a product that
  adopts a scale bound to another category; `5.1` ships the column and the
  picker hint, not a rule.

## D127 — a label print job has no sale, so `PrintJob.saleId` becomes nullable

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. Required by Phase 5 step `5.7`. Touches a
table the restaurant and hardware modules both write to, which is why it gets a
record rather than riding along inside the step.

### The problem

The Phase 5 plan says label rendering is *"a new `PrintJobType` on the existing
queue, reusing the existing print-job queue and print agents"*. That reuse is
right — the queue, the agent polling, the `PENDING → PRINTED → FAILED`
lifecycle and the retry behaviour all already exist and are in production use.

But `PrintJob.saleId` is `String`, **required**, with a cascading FK to `Sale`.
Every job the system has ever created belongs to a sale: a customer receipt, a
warehouse picking slip, a return receipt. A sheet of shelf labels belongs to no
sale at all — it is printed from the catalogue, often for stock that has not
been sold and may never be.

### What was rejected

**A separate `LabelPrintJob` table.** It would duplicate the status lifecycle,
the agent's polling query, the retry logic and the print-agent registration —
four things that are correct today and would then exist twice. The second copy
is where they drift. This is the same argument D124 made for `PROMOTIONS` and
the same one D125 Part 2 made for reusing `DocumentSequence`.

**A synthetic sale.** Inventing a `Sale` row so a label job has something to
point at would put fictional rows in the table every report, every Z-reading and
every tax reconciliation reads. Not seriously considered, recorded so nobody
proposes it later.

### The decision

1. **`PrintJob.saleId` becomes `String?`**, FK `ON DELETE CASCADE` unchanged for
   the rows that have one.
2. **`PrintJobType` gains `PRODUCT_LABEL`.**
3. **No existing row changes.** Every current job keeps its `saleId`; the column
   simply stops being mandatory for new kinds of job.

### Why this is safe for the restaurant and hardware modules

Measured against the code, not assumed:

- Every existing writer — `receipts.service`, `returns.service` — passes a
  `saleId` and continues to. Nothing about their behaviour changes.
- Every existing reader filters by `saleId` **optionally**
  (`QueryPrintJobsDto.saleId?`), so a job without one is simply not returned by
  a sale-scoped query. That is the correct answer, not a gap.
- Widening a column from `NOT NULL` to nullable cannot fail on existing data and
  cannot lose any.

The one real risk is a consumer that reads `job.saleId` and assumes a string.
The compiler names every such site the moment the client is regenerated, which
is the check that makes this a safe widening rather than a hopeful one.

### What this does not decide

- **Label geometry** — `5.8`, and it needs no migration: the settings blob is
  JSON and already scoped `(tenantId, branchId)`.
- **Whether a label job is branch-scoped.** It inherits whatever the queue
  already does. If shelf labels turn out to need a branch the queue does not
  carry, that is a separate change with its own evidence.

## D125b — a correction to D125 Part 2: a rollback does not burn a sequence number

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. Corrects one factual claim in
[D125](#d104) Part 2. **The decision D125 made is unchanged**; only its stated
reason was wrong.

### What D125 said

> **Gaps are accepted.** `nextDocumentNumber` increments inside the transaction,
> so a rolled-back product creation burns a number.

### What is actually true

Measured during `5.3`, against a real Postgres, in
`sku-generation.spec.ts`:

A rolled-back batch burns **nothing**. `nextDocumentNumber` is an
`INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE … RETURNING` executed inside the caller's
transaction, so it rolls back exactly like every other statement in it. In the
observed case the `DocumentSequence` row did not even survive at zero — it was
never committed, so the next allocation started again at 1.

The reasoning in D125 confused "increments inside the transaction" with
"increments outside the caller's control". The first is true and is precisely
why a rollback undoes it.

### Where the gaps really come from

**The collision retry.** Generation allocates a number, composes the SKU, and
finds the composed string already taken by a hand-typed one. It abandons that
number and allocates the next. The abandoned number is gone for good, and that
write commits — so this is a real, permanent gap. Asserted directly: after one
such retry the sequence sits at 2 with a single generated variant.

The same is true of `BARCODE` allocation (`5.5`), which uses the identical
mechanism.

### Why the decision stands anyway

D125 accepted gaps in order to avoid holding a lock across a whole product
creation. That trade-off is unaffected: the retry still must not reuse an
abandoned number, because a reused barcode would eventually reissue an
identifier already on a printed label. A SKU is an identifier, not an audit
trail, and nobody reconciles them.

### Why this is recorded rather than quietly fixed

The claim is load-bearing for anyone reasoning about whether these sequences can
be made gap-free. Someone reading D125 would conclude that gaps are unavoidable
because of rollbacks and stop there; the truth is that rollbacks are clean and
the retry is the only source, which is a much smaller and more tractable
surface. Both behaviours are now pinned by tests, so a future change to
`nextDocumentNumber` that made rollbacks leaky would fail rather than silently
vindicate the old wording.

### What this does not change

- The `DocumentSequence` decision itself, its concurrency argument, or the
  `SKU` / `BARCODE` doc types.
- Anything in D125 Parts 1 or 3.

## D125c — the barcode unique constraint already existed, and `IF NOT EXISTS` hid it

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. Corrects [D125](#d104) Part 3. Found by a
`pnpm db:migrate` that failed against the developer database.

### What D125 Part 3 said

> So `@@unique([tenantId, barcode])` can be added **cleanly, with no remediation
> step and no backfill**. That was the open question blocking this record, and
> the answer is that there is nothing to clean up.

The investigation measured duplicates — correctly, and found none. It never
asked the prior question: **is the constraint already there?**

### What is actually true

It has been there since **D44**, 12 August. `20260812000000_add_product_variants_and_purchase_receipts`
creates it:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "ProductVariant_tenantId_barcode_key"
    ON "ProductVariant"("tenantId", "barcode")
    WHERE "barcode" IS NOT NULL;
```

A **partial** unique index. Prisma cannot express a partial index, which is
precisely why it is not declared in `schema.prisma` — the same situation as
`ProductVariant.isDefault`, whose own comment says so in as many words.

### The failure this caused

Two mistakes compounded.

**1. `@@unique([tenantId, barcode])` in the schema created permanent drift.**
Prisma models that as a FULL unique index. It sees the partial one, decides the
full one is missing, and generates a corrective migration — **on every
`migrate dev`, forever**. That is what happened: Prisma wrote a new migration
containing one `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` and it died with `42P07 relation already
exists`, leaving a failed row in `_prisma_migrations` that blocked all further
migrations on the developer database.

**2. `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` in the `5.6` migration was a silent
no-op.** `IF NOT EXISTS` keys on the NAME. The name was taken, so the statement
did nothing — and reported success. The migration appeared to work on every
database it ran against, including a from-scratch replay, because the D44
migration had already created the index the tests then observed.

**This is the hazard of `IF NOT EXISTS` on a named object:** it protects against
re-running the same statement, and it silently accepts a *different* object that
happens to share the name. It converts "this already exists differently" —
which should be loud — into "fine".

### The decision

1. **`@@unique([tenantId, barcode])` is NOT declared in `schema.prisma`**, with
   a comment recording that D44's partial index is the real constraint and why
   Prisma cannot model it. Verified: `migrate diff --from-migrations
   --to-schema-datamodel` now reports *"This is an empty migration."*
2. **The `5.6` migration is left exactly as it is.** It is already applied on
   two databases and its checksum is recorded; editing it would fail every
   future `migrate deploy` with a modified-migration error. Its index statement
   is a harmless no-op on any database, because D44 always runs first.
3. **No data or index changes.** The two forms are behaviourally identical here:
   Postgres treats NULLs as distinct in a plain unique index too, so the 28
   variants with no barcode are unaffected either way. There is nothing to
   migrate.
4. **The test now proves WHICH index does the work** — it asserts the
   `indexdef`, including the `WHERE (barcode IS NOT NULL)` predicate, and the
   raw `P2002` from the database rather than only the service's friendly 409.
   The previous assertion was `rejects.toBeDefined()`, which would have passed
   for any error at all and is why this was not caught earlier.

### The rule this leaves behind

**Before adding a constraint, check whether it exists — in the migrations, not
only in the data.** D125's investigation was thorough about the rows and silent
about the schema, and the two mistakes above are both downstream of that one
missing question.

**Prefer a plain `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` in a migration over `IF NOT EXISTS`**,
unless the statement genuinely needs to be re-runnable. A name collision should
fail loudly at migrate time, which is the cheapest place to find it.

### What this does not change

- D125 Parts 1 and 2, D125a, D125b, and everything in Part 3 about check digits,
  the reissue pass and `barcodeSource`. Those stand unaltered.
- The measured finding that **18 of 20 pilot barcodes are invalid**. Still true,
  still the reason `5.9` exists.

## D128 — an exchange is a link between a return and a sale, not a third money path

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. Covers Phase 7 (`7.1a`–`7.5`). Carries the
migration mandate for the `Exchange` model.

### The problem

`ModuleKey.EXCHANGES` has been a reserved key with an A4 document renderer and no
workflow since the Phase 0 audit recorded it in **D2**. It is already present in
`RETAIL_MODULES`, so a retail tenant can reach an exchange document today for a
transaction that cannot happen.

Everything an exchange needs already exists: the return path allocates promotions
per line and refunds the tax each line actually paid (D123, `3.11`), the sale path
prices and charges, stock has moved at variant grain in both directions since
Phase 1 (`1a.20`, `1c.6`), `payments` is an array and the till offers Split
Payment, and `STORE_CREDIT` is both a tender and a refund method that QuickBooks
already maps to a credit memo.

What is missing is the thing that joins them.

### The decision

**An exchange is a RETURN followed by a SALE, settled through store credit.**

```
1. Return the Medium   → refundMethod = STORE_CREDIT, value R
2. Sell the Large      → tender STORE_CREDIT for R, plus (P − R) by any method
3. If P < R            → the balance is refunded on the return leg instead
```

`ExchangeService` orchestrates and records. It computes no prices, moves no stock,
touches no tax and writes no payment of its own.

### Why it is composed rather than atomic

`ReturnsRepository` and `SalesRepository` each open their **own** `$transaction`
and neither service accepts an external one. Making an exchange atomic would mean
refactoring the two money paths that the restaurant and hardware modules both
depend on — the largest blast radius available on this branch, spent on a rare
edge.

**The failure mode is recoverable, and it is what the money already means.** If
the replacement sale fails after the return has committed, the customer holds
store credit worth exactly what they handed back. Nothing is lost, nothing is
double-counted, and the operator retries the replacement. That is also how a shop
would handle it at the counter.

**Composition is what makes it correct, not merely cheap.** A bespoke exchange
transaction would have to re-implement promotion allocation, tax snapshots, stock
movement and QuickBooks document typing — four rules that are right today. The
second copy is where they drift, which is the lesson `2.12` and `4.15` each taught
at a cost.

### The model, and why each field is shaped as it is

    Exchange
      tenantId, branchId          ownership, matching Return and Sale
      exchangeNumber              `X-000042`, from DocumentSequence 'EXCHANGE'
      originalSaleId              the sale being exchanged against
      returnId                    the return leg — REQUIRED
      replacementSaleId           the sale leg — NULLABLE
      createdByUserId
      idempotencyKey              nullable, unique per tenant

**`replacementSaleId` is nullable, deliberately.** The return commits first, so
there is a real interval in which an exchange exists with no replacement. A
required column would make the row unwritable until both legs succeeded, which
destroys the recoverable state this record just chose. Unresolved is its own
state (D28/D31), and here it is the state the operator retries from.

**No `status` enum.** The nullable `replacementSaleId` already answers the only
question anyone asks — is the replacement done? A second field encoding the same
fact is a second thing to keep in step. Added later if a real third state appears.

**No line table.** An exchange owns no lines. The returned lines belong to the
`Return`, the replacement lines belong to the `Sale`, and both already snapshot
what they need. A line table here would be a third copy of facts that are already
recorded twice, and it would be the copy nobody updates.

**`DocumentSequence` with docType `EXCHANGE`**, `X-` prefix, matching `R-` and
`S-`. Same mechanism as SKU and BARCODE in Phase 5, and the same accepted
consequence: the collision-free allocation is worth the occasional gap (D125b).

### Idempotency

`@@unique([tenantId, idempotencyKey])`, the shape `Sale` and `Return` already use.
A replayed request returns the existing exchange rather than refunding twice.
This matters more here than elsewhere: an exchange moves money in two directions,
and a duplicate would refund a customer for goods they kept.

### What this does not change

- **Nothing in Returns, Sales, Payments, Stock, Tax, Promotions or QuickBooks.**
  The orchestration calls the existing services and reacts to their results.
- **Return approval rules apply unchanged.** No exchange-specific bypass: a
  non-good-condition or over-limit return still requires approval, because the
  goods coming back are the same goods either way.
- **The replacement is priced at today's terms** — current promotions, current
  tax rate — while the returned line keeps its frozen snapshot. This falls out of
  composition rather than being chosen. A customer swapping M→L may therefore pay
  more or less than they originally did; the PO confirmed this reading.

### What this does change, outside the new model

`DocumentsService.buildExchangeDocument` hardcodes `taxAmount: 0` and passes
`showTaxColumn: false`. It was written before Phase 3 made tax per-line with
snapshots, so an exchange note would show no tax and **would not tie to the money
that actually moved**. Corrected in `7.3`, narrowly.

## D128a — an exchange settles GROSS, not through store credit

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. Supersedes the settlement mechanism in
[D128](#d107); everything else in that record stands.

### What D128 said

> 1. Return the Medium → refundMethod = STORE_CREDIT, value R
> 2. Sell the Large → tender STORE_CREDIT for R, plus (P − R) by any method

### Why it cannot work

`ReturnsService.validateRefundMethod` refuses a store-credit refund unless the
original sale has a **saved, non-walk-in customer**:

```ts
if (!sale.customerId || sale.customer?.customerType === 'WALK_IN') {
  throw new BadRequestException(
    'Store credit requires a saved customer; convert the walk-in customer first');
}
```

That rule is correct. Store credit is a liability held against an account, and a
walk-in has no account to hold it. But **a clothing shop swapping a Medium for a
Large at the counter is almost always a walk-in**, so D128's settlement would
have failed for the common case — and only for the common case, which is the
worst kind of failure to ship.

Found by the `7.1b` tests, all nine of which failed on it. The design read
plausibly on paper and did not survive contact with an existing rule.

### The decision

**The money moves twice and nets at the drawer.**

```
1. Return the Medium   → refunded by `refundMethod`, default CASH, value R
2. Sell the Large      → paid in full by the caller's own tenders, value P
```

For an even swap the customer is handed R and pays P where R = P, so nothing
leaves their pocket and the drawer nets to zero. For an upgrade they are out
(P − R); for a downgrade they are up (R − P). The `Exchange` read model reports
`netDifference = P − R`, which is exactly what the A4 note prints as *"Balance
due from customer"* or *"Refund to customer"*.

### Why this over the alternatives

Three options were put to the PO, who chose this one.

**Rejected — exempt store credit created inside an exchange.** A narrow carve-out
in `validateRefundMethod`, on the argument that credit created and consumed in
one operation never outlives it and so is not a liability. Defensible, and about
five lines. Rejected because it changes an existing money-path rule for the sake
of a mechanism that gross settlement does not need.

**Rejected — require a saved customer for exchanges.** No code change anywhere,
but it puts a customer-creation step in front of every counter size-swap.

**Chosen — gross settlement.** It needs **no change to any existing money path**,
which was the hard constraint on this phase. It is also what actually happens
physically: the shop hands money back and takes money for a different item.

### What follows from it

- `refundMethod` is a caller field defaulting to `CASH`, passed straight to
  `ReturnsService`. Every one of its rules still applies, including the cap that
  a cash refund cannot exceed what was paid on the original sale, and store
  credit remains available for a saved customer who wants it.
- `payments` must cover the replacement **in full**, exactly as for any other
  sale. `SalesService` validates them against the total it computed; the
  exchange service asserts nothing about the money.
- The recoverable state is unchanged in substance and better in practice: if the
  replacement fails, the customer has already been refunded and the operator can
  ring the replacement up as an ordinary sale.

### A consequence worth stating plainly

**A single-line sale exchanged in full always requires manager approval.**
`Full-sale return` is an existing approval trigger, and a customer who bought one
shirt and swaps the size is returning the whole sale. D128 chose to leave return
approval rules unchanged, so this follows from that choice rather than from
gross settlement — but it is the shape most exchanges will take in a clothing
shop, and the till has to handle it. Recorded as a Phase 7 limitation.

---

## D128b — D2's "exchanges are not implemented" caveat is lifted

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. Phase 7 step `7.4`. A status change, not a new
decision.

### What stood until now

The Phase 0 audit (**D2**) recorded `ModuleKey.EXCHANGES` as a reserved key with
an A4 document renderer and no transaction, and this log carried the instruction:

> `ModuleKey.EXCHANGES` remains as D2 left it — a reserved key with an A4
> document renderer and no transaction. The retail template builds that
> transaction; **until it lands, D2's instruction stands and exchange behaviour
> must not be represented as implemented.**

### It has landed

- `Exchange` model and migration — **D128**, `7.1a`
- `ExchangesService` / `ExchangesController`, `POST /exchanges` — `7.1b`
- Stock proven to move on both variants, once — `7.2`
- The A4 note rendered from a real exchange, carrying real tax — `7.3`

So the caveat is lifted, and the three places that repeated it are corrected:
the renderer's own comment, the characterisation spec's premise, and this entry.

### What "implemented" does and does not mean here

Stated precisely, because the caveat existed to stop exchanges being oversold.

**It does mean:** a completed sale can be exchanged for a different variant, the
money moves both ways and nets at the drawer, both stock figures move exactly
once, a replay cannot double-refund, and the customer can be handed a note whose
Balance Due is the figure the till actually took.

**It does not mean:**

- **Anything has been verified by hand.** The supervisor deferred manual UI
  verification to a single pass after all phases. Every Phase 4 defect that
  reached a screen was found by using the app, not by a green suite.
- **Multi-line, cross-branch, or cross-sale exchanges.** Out of scope for the
  thin slice by agreement; none is load-bearing for the phase gate.
- **That a single-line exchange is frictionless.** `Full-sale return` is an
  existing approval trigger, so a customer who bought one shirt and swaps the
  size needs a manager PIN every time. That follows from D128's choice to leave
  return-approval rules unchanged. It is the commonest shape of clothing
  exchange, and the PO may want it revisited — see D128a.

---

## D129 — A8 is handed to the restaurant team; retail adopts the rule instead

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. Phase 8 step `8.1`. Amends the scope recorded
in **D120** and in `05-testing-and-governance.md` §7, which both claim A8 for the
retail template.

### What the plan assumed

The PO settled the billing audit on 2026-08-28: *"we own A4 and A8"*, and the
governance document drew a conclusion from it —

> Excluding [A2, A3, A7] means **no phase in this plan edits a restaurant file.**

**That conclusion is false for A8**, and nobody noticed because nobody opened the
file until Phase 8's pre-work.

### What is actually there

| Report service | Float-money sites |
|---|---|
| `sales/sales-report.service.ts` | 0 |
| `products/products-report.service.ts` | 0 |
| `dashboard/dashboard.service.ts` | 0 |
| `restaurant-reports/restaurant-reports.service.ts` | **15** |

**A8 exists only in the restaurant module.** Every retail report is already
`Decimal`-clean, so there is nothing on our side to fix.

### The decision

1. **A8 is handed to the restaurant team**, documented in
   `Docs/Implementation/RT-02-report-money-handover.md`.
2. **Retail adopts the rule A8 stands for**, as a tripwire over its own report
   services: no retail report may coerce a money `Decimal` to a JavaScript
   number. Mutation-proven, so a future report that reintroduces the pattern
   fails on the branch.
3. **The audit row stays OPEN.** It is not fixed, and marking it otherwise would
   be false. It has changed owner, not state.

### Why not simply fix it

Three standing constraints, any one of which is sufficient:

- The PO's *"do not touch the restaurant module"*, restated repeatedly.
- The developer's own constraint about parallel work in other repositories —
  and `fix/issues-restaurant` has commits from today.
- The governance guarantee above, which the retail branch has honoured through
  seven phases and which is worth more than one mechanical refactor.

The counter-argument — that the PO explicitly assigned A8 — is real, and is why
this is a record rather than a silent omission. The assignment was made from an
audit row, not from the file. Given the file, the assignment cannot be executed
without breaking three other commitments.

### A correction to the audit, which changes the urgency

The audit's impact reads *"Report totals will not tie out to the payment
ledger."* **Measured on 2026-09-07: they do tie out.**

| Test | Samples | Disagreements |
|---|---|---|
| Sum 2dp money, round to 2dp | 400,000 | 0 |
| Sum 3dp quantities, round to 3dp | 600,000 | 0 |
| Accumulate `0.01` ten million times | 1 | 0 |

IEEE-754 doubles carry ~15–16 significant decimal digits; summing 2dp values and
emitting a 2dp figure is exact far beyond any realistic report. The file also
contains **no division**, and D59 already permits a number boundary *"where every
engine output is a 2dp figure"*.

**Where it does break is division**, and that was measured too — an average over
`183.17, 145.76` is `164.47` exactly and `164.46` in float; three orders of
`0.615` average to `0.62` exactly and `0.61` in float. The obvious next
restaurant reports — average order value, margin percentage — are divisions.

So A8 is a **consistency defect with a real future failure mode**, not a current
mis-statement. Recorded here because handing over an overstated claim would have
cost the restaurant team an afternoon disproving it and, reasonably, some trust
in everything else we send them.

### Why the tripwire is the honest half

The PO asked retail to own A8. Retail cannot fix the file, but it can guarantee
the defect does not spread into the nine reports Phase 8 is about to write —
which is where new float money would otherwise appear. That is the part of the
assignment we can actually discharge, and it is enforced rather than promised.

### What this does not change

- **D120 stands unamended.** It claimed A4 and A8 and said why the other three
  were absent. A4 shipped in Phase 4. This record amends only where A8 is done,
  by whom, and on what evidence.
- **A2, A3 and A7 remain not ours.**
- Nothing in the restaurant module is modified by this branch.

## D130 — an exchange waives the full-sale-return approval, and only that one

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. Supersedes one sentence of [D128](#d107).
No migration.

### What D128 decided, and why it was wrong in practice

> **Return approval rules apply unchanged.** No exchange-specific bypass: a
> non-good-condition or over-limit return still requires approval, because the
> goods coming back are the same goods either way.

Sound reasoning, and the Phase 7 tests then showed what it costs. `Full-sale
return` is an approval trigger, and **a customer who bought one shirt and swaps
the size is returning the whole sale**. So every single-line exchange — the
commonest shape in a clothing shop — demanded a manager PIN. Recorded as a Phase
7 limitation with the note *"probably not what a shop wants"*; the PO confirmed
on 2026-09-07 that it is not.

### The decision

**Inside an exchange, the `Full-sale return` trigger does not fire. Every other
trigger still does.**

The waived trigger exists because a full-sale return means the customer walks out
with the entire sale refunded and the shop holds the goods. In an exchange they
walk out with **replacement goods**, and the money largely nets at the drawer.
The condition the trigger detects is simply not present.

**Still requiring a manager, unchanged:**

| Trigger | Why it survives |
|---|---|
| Damaged / opened / defective goods | An exchange does not change what came back |
| Outside the return period | Nor how old it is |
| Cashier over their value limit | Nor who is authorised for how much |
| Refund method differs from the original payment | Money leaving by a different route |
| Cash refund on a non-cash sale | Same |
| Credit customer | Their account is still affected |
| `Other` reason | Still unexplained |

### How it is plumbed, and why not through the DTO

`withinExchange` is an **option on the service method**, not a field on
`CreateReturnDto`:

```ts
returns.complete(tenantId, actor, dto, idempotencyKey, { withinExchange: true })
```

A DTO field would let any caller of `POST /returns` assert it and skip the check
— an approval bypass reachable from the public API by writing one extra line of
JSON. Only `ExchangesService` can set this, and it always does.

### What proves it is narrow

Four integration assertions, and the second is the one that matters:

1. An ordinary size swap completes with **no approval token at all**.
2. **The same return, outside an exchange, still demands a manager.** Without
   this, *"the exchange worked"* would also pass for an implementation that had
   simply switched the trigger off for everyone.
3. A **damaged-goods** exchange is still refused without approval.
4. That same damaged-goods exchange **completes once approved** — so the refusal
   is a gate, not a dead end.

### What this does not change

- Every other part of D128 and D128a: composition over atomicity, gross
  settlement, the nullable `replacementSaleId`, idempotency.
- Standalone returns, which behave exactly as they did.
- The restaurant and hardware modules. `RETURNS` is retail-gated, and the flag
  defaults to `false`, so a caller that does not set it sees the old behaviour
  byte for byte.

## D131 — margin is costed at today's average, and the report says so

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. No migration. Introduced by `8.5`.

### The question

`ProductVariant.averageCost` is maintained by every goods receipt — a weighted
average across every branch, refreshed on each receive — and until `8.5` no
report read it. A shop could see what it sold and never what it made on it.

The question `8.5` had to answer is not "how do we compute margin", it is **which
cost a historical sale is costed at**.

### What was decided

**Margin is `revenue − (quantity × the unit cost as it stands TODAY)`, and every
surface that shows it says that in words.**

`averageCost` moves. A sale from March costed today is only right if nothing has
been received since; a shop buying into a falling market will see its March
margin flattered, and one buying into a rising market will see it understated.
That is a real limitation, not a rounding detail.

### The alternative, and why it is not this phase

Costing a historical sale exactly means **freezing the unit cost onto `SaleItem`
at sale time** — a new column, a migration, a decision record, and a change to
the sale write path that every existing tenant runs through. It is the right
long-term answer and it is deliberately not being done here, for three reasons:

1. It could not answer for sales already taken. Every sale in the pilot database
   would still have to be costed at today's average, so the report needs this
   behaviour regardless.
2. `8.5`'s scope is "read the cost that already exists". Changing how sales are
   written is a different piece of work with a different blast radius, and the
   standing constraint is not to disturb paths that hardware and restaurant
   tenants run through.
3. The approximation is close to exact for the shops this template targets,
   whose costs move slowly.

**Revisit when** a client reports margins that do not match their own books, or
when stock valuation (a related, larger piece) is picked up.

### An unknown cost is not a zero cost

A variant nothing has ever been received against has `averageCost = NULL`. The
row's cost, margin and margin percentage are all `null`; the row is excluded from
the totals; and the excluded rows are counted and their revenue reported
separately, so a reader can see how much of the period the totals do not cover.

Costing NULL as zero would report a **100% margin** on that row — the most
flattering possible number, arrived at by accident. This is the same principle as
D28/D31's *unresolved is its own state*, applied to money.

### A variant never reads its parent's cost

Once `hasVariants` is true, `Product.unitPrice`, `Product.costPrice` and
`Product.averageCost` are legacy columns the schema states are not read, holding
whatever they held before the product gained variants. **D44** is the record of
what happens when a screen reads them anyway: the products list priced every
variant product at `Rs 0.00`.

A margin report reading a stale parent cost would be the same defect one column
over, and worse — it produces a *plausible* margin instead of an obvious zero. So
a variant line is costed from the variant or not at all; only a line sold without
a variant reads the product.

Each row reports which cost it used — `VARIANT_AVERAGE`, `LATEST_PURCHASE`,
`PRODUCT_AVERAGE` or `UNKNOWN` — rather than presenting one figure as though
every part of it were equally solid.

### What this does not change

- No column, table or migration.
- The receipt path. `averageCost` is still written only by
  `inventory-receipts.service`, exactly as before.
- The restaurant and hardware modules. This is a new read on a gated retail
  report route.

## D132 — a stock take states reality; it is not a guarded movement

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. **Migration:** yes — `StockTake`,
`StockTakeLine`. Introduced by `8.7`.

### The question

Every shop counts its stock. Until now this system had no way to record that a
shelf holds four when the books say six: the only stock writes were a sale
(guarded), a return, a receipt, and a bulk-import adjustment.

### The decision, in one line

**A count is an assertion of reality by an operator, and the system records it
rather than arguing with it.**

Concretely:

1. It **sets** the branch's quantity to the counted figure. It does not decrement
   and it is not refused for going down. Refusing a count because it disagrees
   with the books would leave the books wrong and the shelf uncounted.
2. It **writes a `StockMovement`** for every line whose count differed, reason
   `ADJUSTMENT`, so the correction is as auditable as a sale.
3. It **never touches the oversell guard.** `reduceStock`'s conditional
   `updateMany({ where: { quantityOnHand: { gte } } })` is untouched, and no
   count path passes through it. Two things that look similar — "change the
   stock number" — are kept apart because only one of them is a race.

### Why a new provider method, not a service writing stock

`InventoryProvider.adjustStock` already exists and is documented for exactly this
("a stocktake correction is an assertion of reality by an operator"). It could
not be used as it stands: `LocalInventoryProvider.adjustStock` writes
`Product.quantityOnHand` only — no branch, no variant, no `StockMovement`. It is
the legacy bulk-import path, and widening it would change what the product import
does to every existing tenant.

Writing the stock directly from a new service was the other option, and it is
forbidden: *"stock movement lives in exactly one layer — the providers, and
nowhere else"* is an architectural tripwire with an exact file set, and D28/D31
put the routing decision in a provider rather than in conditionals inside a
service.

So `8.7` adds **`applyStockCount`** to the provider interface, exactly as D44
added `receiveStock`:

- `LocalInventoryProvider` implements it.
- `QuickBooksInventoryProvider` and `NoInventoryProvider` **throw**
  `ProviderOperationUnavailableError`. A silent no-op would look like a
  successful count that never moved anything — the same "document with no ledger
  effect" state D44 refused for receipts. QuickBooks stock is a cache of an
  upstream system whose ledger is not ours to write; `NONE` has no stock to
  count.

### Why the document is immutable and has no status

A `StockTake` row is a count that HAPPENED. There is no `DRAFT`, no `POSTED`, no
`status` column at all — a counting session that can be saved and resumed is a
different feature, and a status field with one legal value is the "reserved key
with nothing behind it" shape D2 recorded and Phase 7 spent a step undoing.
Adding a status later is a migration; adding it now is a promise.

The same reasoning gives the line its snapshots: `productNameSnapshot` and
`variantNameSnapshot` are frozen at count time (D44), so a rename cannot rewrite
what was counted.

### What a variance is worth

Each line carries `unitCost` and `varianceValue`, both nullable, resolved by the
same rule as D131 — the variant's own average, then its latest purchase, and for
a variant-less line the product's. **Null, not zero, when nothing has ever been
received**: a shrinkage report that valued unknown stock at zero would say a
missing item cost the shop nothing.

### Authorisation

`INVENTORY` module, and **`product:manage`** — no new permission was minted.

`product:manage` is the permission that already authorises writing stock
quantities: the bulk product import does exactly that today. It is held by Owner,
Admin and Manager, which is the set a count needs, and a cashier does not hold
it.

D44 minted `inventory:receive` rather than reusing `product:manage`, and the
argument it made — a floor manager who receives stock need not also be able to
edit the catalogue — applies equally to counting. It is not being acted on now
because no tenant has asked for that split, and vocabulary added in advance of a
need is vocabulary nobody can remove. **`inventory:count` is the natural next
step** the first time a client wants a counter who is not a catalogue editor.

### What this does not change

- The sale path, the return path, the receipt path: byte for byte.
- `adjustStock`, which the product import still calls, unchanged.
- Restaurant and hardware tenants. `applyStockCount` is reachable only through a
  new `INVENTORY`-gated route, and the restaurant module has no caller.

## D133 — brand is an entity, not a string on a product

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. **Migration:** yes — `Brand`, plus a nullable
`Product.brandId`. Introduced by `8.9`.

### The question was settled in advance

D64 (`2.4`) chose the clothing attribute schema and deliberately left brand out
of it, recording why:

> **Why `brand` is absent.** It is a **column eventually** (Phase 8 — "brand as
> an entity"): filtered and reported on, and free text will not survive real
> data. Declaring it here now would mean migrating tenants' stored strings into
> an entity later. Leaving it out costs nothing today.

`8.9` is that entity. The prediction has been paid off rather than revisited, and
no tenant has a stored brand string to migrate — which is exactly the outcome
D64 was buying.

### Why an entity rather than a validated string

The test D64 states for attribute-vs-dimension does not apply here, because brand
is neither. The test that does apply is **what happens to the data over a year**:

- A free-text brand gives `Nike`, `nike`, `NIKE ` and `Nkie` as four brands. A
  buyer's "how did Nike do this season" then answers three quarters of the
  question, and nothing in the system can tell them so.
- An enum in the attribute schema would be worse: `attributeSchema` is a
  per-DOMAIN list in code, and brands are per-TENANT data. Every shop would
  share one list, and adding a brand would be a deployment.

So: a row per tenant per brand, referenced by id.

### The link is nullable, and stays nullable

`Product.brandId` is `String?` with `onDelete: SetNull`.

**Nullable** because most products in a hardware or grocery catalogue have no
brand worth recording, and a required link would make every existing product
un-editable until someone invented a brand for it. "Unbranded" is not a brand; it
is the absence of one, and null is how the schema says that (D28/D31 —
*unresolved is its own state*).

**`SetNull`** because retiring a brand must never delete a product. A shop that
stops stocking a label still sold those garments, and the sale lines that
reference them are history.

### Archived, not deleted

A brand is deactivated (`isActive: false`) rather than removed. Deleting one
would silently unlink every product that used it, and the products are the
records that matter. Archived brands stay readable so an old product still shows
what it was, and are filtered out of the pickers where a new choice is made.

### What `8.9` does NOT do

- **No markdown pricing.** Open question 6, answered by the PO on 2026-09-07:
  *"absolutely still no"*. Scheduled percentage promotions (Phase 4) already
  cover the selling behaviour; what is given up is the *was / now* pair on a
  shelf label and a "how much did we lose to markdowns" report. Deferred, not
  rejected. **`8.9` carries its migration alone**, exactly as the phase plan
  says.
- **No brand on a sale line.** A sale line snapshots the product NAME (D44); it
  does not snapshot a brand id, and reporting resolves the brand from the product
  as it stands today — the same choice, for the same reason, that `8.3` makes
  about product names.

### What this does not change

- Every existing product, which keeps `brandId = NULL` and behaves identically.
- The restaurant and hardware modules: one new table, one nullable column, and a
  `PRODUCT_*`-permissioned route set that no restaurant screen calls.

## D134 — weighed goods are a software prompt, not a hardware integration

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. **Planning only — no code written.** Migration
required when built (`Product.quantityType`). Unblocks the **weighed-goods** part
of Phase 6; the rest of that phase stays parked (see the end of this record).

### The decision

A product declares how it is measured. A cashier selling a measured product is
asked for the measurement. Nothing else changes.

```
Product.quantityType : WHOLE | DECIMAL     default WHOLE
```

| Scenario | Flag | Behaviour |
|---|---|---|
| Cashier taps a shirt | `WHOLE` | Quantity 1 goes straight into the cart. No interruption |
| Cashier taps "Rice, Rs 200/kg" | `DECIMAL` | The cart addition is intercepted; a numpad asks for the weight. `0.750` is entered, read off an ordinary offline scale |

The line is then a normal line of quantity `0.750`, and every existing rule —
pricing, tax, stock depletion, returns — applies to it unchanged.

### Why this is the right shape

Digital-scale drivers and variable-measure barcode decoding are both real work
with real vendor variation, and neither is needed to sell rice. A shop already
owns a scale; the cashier can already read it. The system's job is to accept the
number, not to acquire it.

It also fails safe. A tenant that never sets `DECIMAL` on anything is running the
code that exists today, byte for byte.

### What was verified before accepting this, and what it changes

The premise "the backend foundation already supports this math" was checked
against the code rather than assumed. **It holds** — and one part of the
surrounding story does not.

**Confirmed:**

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Quantities are `Decimal(12,3)` throughout | `SaleItem.quantity`, `BranchInventory.quantityOnHand`, `StockMovement.delta`, `ReturnItem.quantity`, `InventoryReceiptLine.quantityReceived` — all `@db.Decimal(12, 3)`. Three places is grams |
| The API already accepts a fractional quantity | `SaleItemInputDto.quantity` is `@IsNumber() @IsPositive()` — **not** `@IsInt()`. A `0.750` posted today is accepted and stored |
| Returns carry no whole-number assumption | No `IsInt` and no flooring in the returns DTOs or `returns.calc` |
| Nothing collides with the new column | `Product` has no unit-of-measure, weight or scale field to conflict with |

**Corrected — and this is the part worth carrying forward:**

> **Phase 6's weighed-goods work was never blocked by hardware. It is blocked by
> the till.**

`apps/web/src/lib/pos-cart.tsx` clamps every typed quantity to a whole number:

```ts
let q = Math.max(1, Math.floor(quantity));   // setQty
```

and the `+`/`−` stepper moves in units of one (`changeQty(lineKey, ±1)`). A
cashier who types `0.750` today gets `1`. So the work this decision authorises is
**frontend work on the cart**, not backend work and not driver work — which is a
smaller, better-understood job than the plan implied, but it is not nothing, and
the schema being ready does not make it free.

### The rule that must not be broken when this is built

**The numpad must not compute the price.** It collects a quantity; the line total
is computed where every other line total is computed.

This branch has paid for that lesson twice: `2.12` (four sale-line renderers, two
of them fixed, so the same sale printed differently from different endpoints) and
`3.10` (the till quoted 18% on an item the server then zero-rated). D59 says one
money engine. A weighed line is the easiest place in the system to grow a second
one, because `0.750 × 200` looks too simple to be worth centralising.

### Open sub-question — promotions on a measured line

**Not decided here. It needs an answer before this is built.**

`packages/shared/src/promotions/applier.ts` counts in whole units:

```ts
times  = Math.floor(quantityOf(lines, productId) / perBundle);
earned = Math.floor(buyPool / buyQty) * getQty;
req.set(it.productId, (req.get(it.productId) ?? 0) + Math.max(1, it.quantity));
```

"Buy 2, get 1 free" on 0.75 kg of rice has no defined meaning, and
`Math.max(1, it.quantity)` quietly rounds a 0.75 kg line **up** to one unit for
eligibility — so a customer buying 750 g today would count as a whole unit toward
a bundle. That is not a bug against current data, because no product can be
fractional yet; it becomes one the day this decision is implemented.

Three readings, in the order I would recommend them:

1. **Quantity-based promotions do not apply to `DECIMAL` products.** Percentage
   and fixed-amount promotions still do. Simplest, hardest to get subtly wrong,
   and matches how most grocers actually price ("10% off all rice", not "buy 2 kg
   get 1 kg").
2. Quantity promotions apply on whole units only, fractions ignored.
3. Quantity promotions apply pro-rata.

**Whoever picks needs to say so in a follow-up record**, and the applier needs a
test either way — a promotion that silently treats 0.75 kg as one unit is exactly
the kind of thing that ships green.

### Scope — what this does and does not unblock

**Unblocked:** selling by weight or measure. A grocer can price rice per kilo and
sell 750 g of it.

**Still parked, unchanged:**

- Per-category tax rates (`3.1`–`3.3`) — zero-rated staples beside standard-rated
  goods. A separate requirement with its own migration.
- The grocery `attributeSchema` (was `2.5`) — still closed rather than open:
  Q12 resolved *do not split `RETAIL`*, so a grocery tenant would be shown the
  clothing schema. Needs a grocery customer to say what a grocer records.
- Variable-measure barcode decoding (`21`/`22` prefixes) — genuinely a hardware/
  vendor concern, and **this decision is what makes it optional rather than
  prerequisite**. A shop can operate with the numpad and adopt scale labels later.
- Footwear size scales — unrelated, still needs a local retailer.

**Phase 6 is therefore not "unblocked" as a whole.** One of its four parked items
now has an implementation path that needs no hardware; the other three are
untouched.

### What must be true of the implementation

Recorded now so the sprint does not re-litigate it:

1. **`quantityType` defaults to `WHOLE`** on the column, so every existing row —
   restaurant, hardware, retail — reads as it does today with no backfill.
2. **The flag is read, never inferred.** No component may guess "this looks like
   rice". Same rule as D56: read a capability, never a business type.
3. **The server does not trust the client's arithmetic.** It already recomputes
   every line; a `DECIMAL` line changes no part of that.
4. **The prompt is cancellable**, and cancelling adds nothing to the cart. A
   half-added line is worse than no line.
5. **`0` is refused, not accepted as an empty line.** `@IsPositive()` already
   refuses it server-side; the numpad should refuse it sooner.
6. **Stock, returns and reports need no change** — they are already `Decimal`.
   `8.3`'s `formatReportQuantity` already renders `0.750` as `0.75`, which was
   written for loose goods before this decision existed.

## D134a — a measured product is invisible to quantity-based promotions

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. **Planning only — no code written.** Closes the
open sub-question in [D134](#d113). No migration of its own.

### The decision

**Option 1**, chosen by the PO:

| Promotion kind | Applies to a `DECIMAL` product? |
|---|---|
| `BUY_X_GET_Y` | **No** |
| `BUNDLE_FIXED_PRICE` | **No** |
| `PERCENTAGE_DISCOUNT` | **Yes** |
| `FIXED_AMOUNT_DISCOUNT` | **Yes** *(both line-level and cart-level)* |

"10% off all rice" works. "Buy 2 get 1 free" on rice does not exist.

### Why

"Buy 2, get 1 free" on 0.75 kg has no meaning that a customer and a cashier
would agree on before an argument. The other two readings — whole units only,
and pro-rata — are both defensible and both surprising, and a promotion that
surprises a customer at the till costs more than one that never fires.

It also matches how grocers price in practice: percentage and amount-off on
weighed goods, bundles on packaged ones.

### Where it goes, and the shape it must take

`claimsFor` in `packages/shared/src/promotions/applier.ts` is already a single
dispatch on `rule.type`. The bypass belongs there — the two quantity-based
branches see a filtered line list, the other two see the full one.

**`PromotionCartLine` must carry the flag.** It currently holds `productId`,
`unitPrice`, `quantity`, `lineSubtotal` and `manualDiscountAmount` and nothing
else, so the applier cannot know a product is measured unless it is told. There
is a proven precedent for exactly this shape: `manualDiscountAmount` non-zero
already makes a line invisible to promotions (D123). This is the same idea,
narrowed to two of the four kinds.

**Both callers must set it.** The till builds a `PromotionCartLine` for the badge
and the server builds one for the charge. If only one sets the flag, the cashier
is shown a discount the server refuses — which is `2.12` and `3.10` again, and
this branch has paid for that lesson twice. A test must assert the two agree.

### The latent rounding this makes safe

`applier.ts` currently does:

```ts
req.set(it.productId, (req.get(it.productId) ?? 0) + Math.max(1, it.quantity));
```

which rounds a fractional line **up to one whole unit** for bundle eligibility.
Harmless today because no product can be fractional. With D134 shipped and
without this bypass, 750 g of rice would count as a whole unit toward "buy 2 get
1 free" — a customer getting a free bag for buying one and a half.

**The bypass is what makes that line safe, not a fix to it.** Leave it: it is
correct defence for a caller that forgets the flag, and a test should prove a
measured line never reaches it.

### What must be tested (D30)

Both directions, or the assertion is worth nothing:

1. **Positively** — a `PERCENTAGE_DISCOUNT` DOES discount a 0.75 kg line.
2. **Negatively** — a `BUY_X_GET_Y` naming that product yields no claim on it.
3. A **whole** product in the same basket still wins its bundle, so the filter
   removes the measured line and not the promotion.
4. The till's preview and the server's charge agree on the same basket.

## D134b — the measured-product contract: unit, switching, and entry bounds

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. **Planning only — no code written.** Closes
`6.1-Q1`, `Q3` and `Q4` from the Phase 6 plan, and records the approved scope
(`Q5`, `Q7`). Extends [D134](#d113); no migration of its own beyond the column in
§1.

### 1. A measured product names its unit *(Q1 — yes)*

```prisma
model Product {
  quantityType   QuantityType @default(WHOLE)   // D134
  unitOfMeasure  String?                        // D134b
}
```

**Same migration as `quantityType`.** Adding it later would mean a second
migration *and* re-editing every measured product a shop had already set up.

**Free text — `kg`, `g`, `L`, `m`, `ft`.** Nothing computes on it; it is printed,
exactly like `material` in the clothing attribute schema. A controlled list would
be a guess about a market nobody in this project has met, which is the mistake
`2.6` refused to make about UK-versus-EU footwear scales.

It is what lets the numpad ask *"How many kg?"* rather than *"How many?"*, the
receipt print `0.750 kg`, and a shelf label read `Rs 200/kg`.

**Nullable at the column**, because a `WHOLE` product has no unit and a required
column would demand one for every shirt in every tenant.

> **New sub-question this creates — `6.1-Q2`.** Should `unitOfMeasure` be
> **required when `quantityType` is `DECIMAL`**? A measured product without one
> prints `0.750` and asks *"How many?"*, which is the state the field exists to
> prevent.
>
> **Recommendation: enforce it in the service, not in the column.** The database
> cannot express "required only when another column has a particular value"
> without a check constraint Prisma will not model, and the same rule then has to
> exist in the API anyway. One rule, in the place that can state it.

### 2. Switching `WHOLE` ⇄ `DECIMAL` is allowed, and warns *(Q3)*

**Allowed.** A shop that flags something wrongly on its first day must be able to
correct it, and blocking the change would trap them.

**Warned, because stored quantities are NOT converted.** `quantityOnHand: 100`
meant a hundred pieces yesterday; after the switch it means a hundred kilograms.
Historical sale lines keep whatever integer quantity they were sold at. Nothing is
corrupted and nothing is migrated — the *meaning* of stored numbers changes, and
only a person can say whether that is right.

**The warning must be specific and must name the counts**, on the screen where
the change is made:

> *"This product has **100** on hand and **14** recorded sales. Changing how it is
> measured does not convert them — 100 will now read as 100 kg."*

**No conversion factor is applied, ever.** Converting would require knowing how
much one piece weighed, which nobody can supply and the system has never
recorded.

### 3. Entry bounds at the numpad *(Q4)*

| Bound | Rule | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Decimals** | **Maximum 3** | The column is `Decimal(12,3)`. A fourth place is silently truncated by the database, so it must be refused where the operator can still see it |
| **Minimum** | **None beyond "greater than zero"** | 5 g of saffron is a real sale. `@IsPositive()` already refuses `0` server-side; the numpad refuses it sooner |
| **Maximum** | **Existing stock, via `stockCap`** | Already decimal-safe and already the rule for every other line. No invented ceiling |

### 4. Approved scope *(Q5, Q7)*

**Track A only.** Steps `6.1`–`6.6`. Weighed goods, end to end.

**Track B — per-category tax — is deferred again**, and this is the record of why
it is safe to defer:

> **Zero-rated staples beside standard-rated goods already work today**, per
> product, end to end: `Product.taxable` (exposed in the wizard, `3.13`), the
> tenant rate (`3.15`), `taxableBase` removing exempt lines and their share of the
> order discount (`3.10`), the per-line snapshot of `0` (`3.9`), returns reading
> that snapshot (`3.11`) and the receipt breaking it down (`3.12`).
>
> The only capability Track B genuinely adds is **two different non-zero rates**
> in one basket. No customer has asked for it, and building it would edit
> `computeDocumentTotals` — the one money engine the restaurant module shares,
> which no phase in this plan has touched in eight phases.

**Track C — the grocery attribute schema — is deferred with the sprint**, but its
approach is now settled: see **D135**.

## D134e — the server refuses measured goods outside RETAIL

> Recorded at merge time (D136a) from commit `1887632`, which cites this
> record; the branch never wrote it. The text is the commit's reasoning.

The wizard stopped offering "How is this sold?" outside RETAIL, but hiding
is usability only and the server stays the authority. Until this record a
direct `POST /v1/products` could still make a hardware product `DECIMAL` —
and hardware runs the retail till, so a numpad would have appeared for it.

**Where it lives.** On `ProductAttributesService`, because `ProductsService`
may not reference `BusinessProfileService` (D28, with a tripwire enforcing
it) and that class exists for exactly this: domain data validation resolved
from the profile, thrown as an ordinary refusal
(`MEASURED_GOODS_NOT_OFFERED`, 400). It reads the domain registry's
`catalogue.measuredGoods` capability — RETAIL declares it; hardware and
food service do not — never a business-type conditional.

**It reads the incoming value, not the resulting state.** D134c's unit
check reads the resulting state, because measured-with-no-unit is invalid
however it is arrived at. This rule is the opposite, deliberately: a row
can be `DECIMAL` in a domain that no longer offers it — created before the
capability existed, or before the workspace changed type. Reading the
resulting state would refuse every edit to that row, including the one
that fixes it. So the rule is "you may not ASSERT measured here", not "no
measured row may exist here": an already-`DECIMAL` hardware product can
still be renamed, and switched back to `WHOLE`.

**Tests.** Six in `weighed-goods.spec.ts`, both sides: the refusal paired
with a positive control (the identical create succeeds for RETAIL), an
invisibility check (an ordinary `WHOLE` create in a hardware workspace
notices nothing) and a second domain (food service is refused too, proving
the registry is read).

## D135 — a tenant picks its catalogue attribute pack — **SUPERSEDED by D161**

> **Withdrawn unbuilt, 2026-09-09.** D161 answers the same problem by letting a
> tenant define its OWN field list rather than pick from lists we wrote, which
> needs no `cataloguePack` column and no migration. The two traps this decision
> identified were both real and are both answered there. Kept in full below

> will be asked again.

**Status:** ~~accepted, 2026-09-07~~ superseded. **Planning only — no code written.**
Migration would have been required when built (`TenantBusinessProfile.cataloguePack`).
Answers `Q6`; was to implement Phase 6 step `6.10`.

### The problem

`ProductAttributesService.schemaForTenant` resolves **one schema per business
type**:

```ts
const profile = await this.profiles.getEffectiveProfile(tenantId);
return domainFor(profile.businessType).catalogue.attributeSchema;
```

The `RETAIL` descriptor declares one list, and it is the clothing one —
`material`, `fit`, `careInstructions`, `gender`, `season`. Clothing and grocery
are both `RETAIL`, and **Q12 resolved: do not split `RETAIL`**.

So a grocer is asked for **Fit** and **Season**, and `validateAttributes` refuses
`allergens` as an unknown key. Not a missing feature — an actively wrong one.

### The decision

**A domain may declare named attribute packs; a tenant selects one.**

```ts
readonly catalogue: {
  /** Used when a tenant has selected nothing. Unchanged for every domain today. */
  readonly attributeSchema: readonly AttributeField[];
  /** Named alternatives. Absent for a domain with only one. */
  readonly attributePacks?: Readonly<Record<string, readonly AttributeField[]>>;
};
```

`RETAIL` declares `attributeSchema` as the clothing list **byte for byte as it is
now**, plus `attributePacks: { clothing, grocery }`.

Stored as **one nullable column**, `TenantBusinessProfile.cataloguePack String?`.

**Nullable is the safety property.** `NULL` means "use the default", so every
existing tenant — clothing, hardware, restaurant, every domain — resolves exactly
as it does today with no backfill. Only a tenant that explicitly selects a pack
sees anything different.

The resolver becomes:

```ts
const domain = domainFor(profile.businessType);
return (profile.cataloguePack && domain.catalogue.attributePacks?.[profile.cataloguePack])
    ?? domain.catalogue.attributeSchema;
```

The pack is chosen at workspace creation — the console already asks which
template — or later in Settings.

### Why not split the business type

Because `businessType` drives far more than catalogue fields, and clothing and
grocery are identical in all of it:

| What `businessType` decides | Clothing vs grocery |
|---|---|
| Modules enabled | same |
| Navigation | same |
| Capabilities | same |
| Role templates | same |
| POS workspace | same |
| Console template card | same |
| **Catalogue attribute fields** | **different** |

Splitting duplicates six identical things to vary the seventh, costs an enum
migration and D120a's two-migration dance, and re-opens a decision the PO has
already made (Q12). The pack targets the one row that differs.

### Why not merge the two lists

A clothing shop would be asked for **Allergens** and a grocer for **Fit**. It is
the cheapest option and therefore the one that will look tempting under sprint
pressure; it is recorded here as rejected so it does not get re-proposed.

### Two traps, both required in the build

**1. Switching a tenant's pack strands their stored attributes.**
`validateAttributes` refuses unknown keys, so a product holding `fit: 'Slim'`
fails its next full write once the tenant moves to the grocery pack. Same
mechanism D64 documents for removing a field, new trigger. **The build must
either refuse the switch once products carry attributes, or make it an explicit
operation with a warning naming the count** — the same shape D134b requires for
switching a product's measurement.

**2. A pack is a commitment, not a sketch.** Removing a field later strands
whatever tenants stored under it. D64 says this of the schema and it is equally
true of a pack.

### What this does NOT decide

**The grocery pack's field list.** `04-format-packs.md` §4 drafts
`countryOfOrigin · allergens · storageInstructions · nutritionPer100g`, and that
draft needs a real grocer before it is committed to — for exactly the reason
`2.5` was parked.

**Brand is not in it.** `04` listed brand as a grocery attribute; **D133** made it
an entity, so it is a column with a filter and a report, not a text field.

---

## D134c — a measured product must name its unit, enforced in the service

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-07. **Planning only — no code written.** Closes
`6.1-Q2`, the sub-question [D134b §1](#d113b) opened. No migration; no change to
the column.

### The decision

**A product whose `quantityType` is `DECIMAL` must carry a non-empty
`unitOfMeasure`. The rule lives in `ProductsService`, not in the column.**

`Product.unitOfMeasure` stays `String?` — nullable — exactly as D134b §1
declared it.

### Why not the column

The requirement is **conditional**: mandatory for a `DECIMAL` product, meaningless
for a `WHOLE` one. A `NOT NULL` column would demand a unit of measure for every
shirt, every service line and every restaurant menu item in every tenant.

Postgres could express it as a `CHECK` constraint, but Prisma will not model one,
so it would live only in raw migration SQL — invisible to the schema, invisible to
the client, and reported to a user as a constraint-violation string rather than a
sentence. And the API would still need its own check to produce a usable 400, so
the rule would exist twice with only one of the two readable.

**One rule, in the place that can state it.**

### Where it goes

`ProductsService.create` and `ProductsService.update`, beside
`assertValidDocument` (D64 attributes) and `resolveBrand` (D133) — the service
already owns exactly this kind of cross-field validation.

**It must be checked against the RESULTING state, not the payload.** `update` is
partial (D133 relies on that: absent leaves a brand alone, `''` clears it), so
both of these must be refused:

| Request | Existing row | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `{ quantityType: 'DECIMAL' }` | `unitOfMeasure: null` | **refused** — turning a product into a measured one without saying in what |
| `{ unitOfMeasure: '' }` | `quantityType: DECIMAL` | **refused** — removing the unit from a measured product |
| `{ name: 'Rice' }` | `DECIMAL`, `'kg'` | allowed — a partial update that touches neither |
| `{ quantityType: 'WHOLE' }` | `unitOfMeasure: null` | allowed — a whole product needs no unit |

A check against the payload alone passes the first two, which are the only cases
worth guarding.

### The message matters

`"A product sold by weight or measure needs a unit — for example kg, g or L."`

Not `"unitOfMeasure is required"`. The person reading it is a shopkeeper adding
rice, and `4.19` cost two hours on a promotion that behaved correctly and
explained nothing.

### The client asks too, and is not the authority

The product wizard should require the field once `DECIMAL` is chosen, so the
operator is never allowed to reach a refusal they could have been shown. That is
usability; the server's refusal is what makes it true. **Frontend hiding is
usability only** — the standing rule in `CLAUDE.md`.

### What must be tested (D30 — both directions)

1. **Negative:** creating a `DECIMAL` product with no unit is refused.
2. **Negative:** clearing the unit on an existing `DECIMAL` product is refused.
3. **Positive:** creating a `WHOLE` product with no unit **succeeds** — otherwise
   the rule would pass for an implementation that demanded a unit from everyone.
4. **Positive:** a partial update that mentions neither field leaves both alone.

## D134d — a document prints the unit the line was SOLD in

**Status:** accepted, 2026-09-08. **Migration:** yes — `SaleItem.unitOfMeasureSnapshot`
and `ReturnItem.unitOfMeasureSnapshot`, both nullable. Introduced by `6.5`.
Extends [D134b §1](#d113b).

### The question

D134b §1 says the unit is what lets "the receipt print `0.750 kg`". A receipt
renderer has a `SaleItem`, and `unitOfMeasure` is on `Product`. So either the
renderer joins the product, or the sale line carries the unit.

### The decision

**Snapshot it, like every other thing a document prints.**

`SaleItem` already freezes `productName`, `sku`, `variantSkuSnapshot`,
`variantNameSnapshot` and `promotionNameSnapshot` at sale time, and D44 states
why: a document must show what was sold, **at the name it was sold under**. A
later rename must not rewrite a receipt printed last year.

The unit is the same kind of fact, and the failure mode of joining is worse than
a wrong name:

> A shop prices saffron per gram, then switches to kilograms. Every historical
> receipt reprints `0.750 kg` where the customer actually bought **0.750 g** —
> wrong by a factor of a thousand, on a document someone may be holding.

A snapshot cannot do that. Nullable, because every line written before this
column existed has no unit and `NULL` is the honest answer — the same contract
`taxRatePercent` uses (D122), where `NULL` means "not recorded" rather than a
fabricated default.

### `ReturnItem` gets it too, for the same reason

`3.8` added `taxRatePercent` to both tables in one migration because a credit
note is a document as much as a receipt is. A refund line printing a bare
`0.750` while the original receipt says `0.750 kg` is the same defect one
document over.

### What renders it

**One shared formatter**, `saleLineQuantity`, in `@hardware-pos/shared` beside
`saleLineLabel`.

`2.12` is the reason: four renderers print a sale line, `1c.7` fixed two of
them, and the same sale printed correctly from one endpoint and wrongly from
another. `sale-line-renderers.spec` enumerates all four and fails if one skips
the shared helper. Three of the four currently format quantity three different
ways — one of them a ternary whose branches are identical.

A line with no unit renders exactly as it does today, so every existing document
is unchanged.

### What this does not change

- Any money. The unit is printed, never computed on.
- The restaurant path: `ProjectedSaleItem` carries only the fields it lists, so a
  restaurant bill writes `NULL` here and prints what it always printed — the same
  mechanism that leaves `taxRatePercent` null there (3.16).

### D136 — merging `feature/retail-template`: how each clash was decided

`origin/feature/retail-template` (99 commits, 2026-08-28 to 09-08, cut from
the restaurant tip `4f0be1b`) was merged into `merge/restaurant-changes` after
D119. It brings the Retail vertical: the `RETAIL` business type and its
clothing domain (D120), stock tracked by variant (D121), per-line tax (D122),
promotions (D123, D124, D126), the option library, barcodes and labels (D125,
D127), exchanges (D128–D130), reports, stock takes and brands (D131–D133),
weighed goods (D134) and attribute packs (D135). Twenty-six files conflicted.
What follows is every decision that was more than "take both".

**Decision numbers, a third time.** The branch numbered its records D99–D114
with a–e sub-records; this branch already held D99–D119. Theirs moved up by
twenty-one — D99→D120 … D114→D135, sub-letters kept, anchors and migration
comments included — in one commit on the branch's own history. The first
pass missed D105–D109 (a pattern that covered 100–104 and 110–114 and skipped
the middle); the branch commit was amended and the merge re-pointed at it, so
the merge's second parent carries the whole renumber. Three migration
DIRECTORIES keep their old numbers in their names — `…_stock_take_d111`,
`…_brand_entity_d112`, `…_weighed_goods_d113`, `…_unit_snapshot_d113d` —
because a migration's directory name is its identity in `_prisma_migrations`
and none has been applied anywhere yet only by luck; their header comments
say D132, D133 and D134.

**Production's migrations are `main`'s, and none was touched.** Their
thirteen migrations are all additive: two enum values (`RETAIL`,
`PROMOTIONS` — each added in its own migration so a later one may use it,
D120a), nullable or defaulted columns on `Product`, `SaleItem`, `ReturnItem`
and `PrintJob` (`saleId` becomes nullable for label jobs, D127 — the D68
`SET NOT NULL` runs first in lexical order, then this), and seven new tables.
The merged set is 84. Proven as before: an empty database applies all 84 and
reads up to date; a database at `main`'s 27, with a customer-account payment
and a legacy product seeded between, applies the remaining 57, keeps both rows
(the product reads `taxable = true`, `quantityType = WHOLE`, no brand), holds
`Sale_tenantId_completedAt_idx` once and reads up to date; `migrate diff`
emits only the D44 FK pair (O6). Two names are created twice in the whole
set and both are a drop-and-re-add inside one migration; the barcode unique
index is created `IF NOT EXISTS` by D125c on top of D44's, harmlessly.

**The clothing Retail template is Owner + Cashier.** Their descriptor took
`HARDWARE_ROLE_TEMPLATES`, which meant Owner + Cashier when written. D108 has
since made that list Owner, Salesperson, Cashier with the Salesperson
hardware-only; the descriptor now takes `GENERAL_ROLE_TEMPLATES`, which is
exactly the two it wanted. Whether a clothing shop should also offer a
Salesperson is a product question (O10), not something a merge decides.

**Their own tripwire was red, and is green.** The providers-adoption spec on
their branch listed the stock-take module among the adopters but never
widened `ADOPTED_PATHS`, and three of their specs import from the providers
directory — one to pin the LOCAL provider's rollup rule, two to borrow the
testkit's source analyser. The spec now treats a `providers/testkit` import
as what it is (an analyser, not an adoption), `modules/stock-takes` is an
adopted path (D132 designed it as a provider consumer), and the rollup spec
lives beside the provider it pins, where the scan does not look.

**Unions.** `Sale` gains their two exchange relations beside `main`'s
`markedPaidBy` and the tabs' `billSplits`; the sales module imports both
`CreditModule` and `PromotionsModule`; the products module keeps one
`SettingsModule` import with both reasons; `sellable.service` keeps the 86
switch's `SOLD_OUT` state and gains their variant-grain rollup branch; the
retail receipt template imports both the credit/timezone helpers and
`taxRateLabel`; `provision-tenant.ts` keeps D108's role validation and linking
and gains their clothing pack and `--with-samples`; the integration harness
runs Prisma through `node` (their fix) — no shell, no `.cmd`; `.gitattributes`
keeps the superset (`text=auto` plus the LF rules, theirs was the `*.sh` line
alone). The remaining ten files — the retail till and its cart, the payment
page, the product wizard and detail page, the document renderer and the
settings page — are unions worked file by file; their outcomes and the doubts
they raised are listed in the merge commit and below.

**The ten worked files.** Each union was resolved by one agent and checked
by another, adversarially, against both parents; what follows is what the
check changed or could not settle.

- *The retail till, its cart and the payment page.* A line is priced from the
  size it names (`linePrice`) and discounted per unit or per line as `main`
  says (2026-09-07), so `computeDiscount` takes the quantity; the cap is
  `stockCap(product, variant)` in `cart.ts`, re-exported from the cart store
  so the stepper and the warning still read one function. `setQty` keeps
  their conditional clamp (a measured line floors at 0.001, D134) and
  `main`'s "floor last" order, so a cap of 0 leaves a line visibly short
  instead of clearing its warning. The one place the stock guard runs is
  `commitAdd`, judged against the chosen size; a scanned product whose every
  size is out is refused before the picker opens (both parents refused it,
  the first union let it through). The manager-approval dialog says which
  basis it is approving. `noteItem` looked its line up by product id against
  a line key — their latent bug; fixed. The payment page maps lines through
  the sale mapper, which now carries `discountBasis` and is pinned to; the
  page no longer states the basis a second time.
- *The product wizard and the detail page.* The union of both `WizardState`
  shapes; their `taxRatePercent` prop reaches the three `<StepDetails>` renders
  `main` had added without it (`null` — unresolved, which is what those tests
  are not about). Their `resolveImageUrl` wrap on the detail page's two
  `<ProductImage>` sites was dropped as a no-op: the component resolves the
  URL itself and neither side had touched it.
- *The document renderer.* One import list; the discount note and per-line tax
  amount both render; the shop-timezone date sits beside their columns.
- *The settings page.* Timezone and tax rate are two dirty flags and one
  `PUT`; the tax-rate render test's fixture gained the timezone field.

**A regression `main` had already fixed once, caught by the check.** Their
till reads the ONE read model (D101), and the read model decided "has a
count" from `sellableKind` alone. `deriveSellableKind` maps a QuickBooks
NonInventory item to `STOCK_ITEM`, and the migration that added the column
left every legacy Service row there too — so on the merged till a Tile Shop
NonInventory item at its placeholder 0 read `OUT`, was greyed out, and
blocked the cart it was in: POL-1976 again (`main` 1ba3900). The read model
now says UNTRACKED for anything whose type is not Inventory, which is the
sale guard's own rule (`trackInventory: product.type === 'Inventory'`); the
item carries its `type` so the tile can still say "Non-Inventory" rather
than "Service" (D16); both directions are pinned server- and client-side.
The held-basket mapper had the same silent drop as the sale mapper and now
IS the sale mapper plus the note.

**Counts and catalogue.** The route matrix reads 316 routes, 216 guarded,
100 open (their 309/210/99 plus the tabs' and the queue's routes); its
per-controller tables were already fifteen controllers behind the registry
before this merge and are left as they were — the totals are what the spec
enforces. The catalogue gained forty-three rows for D120–D135 (their branch
wrote none) — PROD, POS, SET, DOC, two new sections (STK, RPT) and the
Exchange rows, whose "not implemented" banner D128 has made false; EXC-T-005
stays blocked because retail runs no accounting provider. Writing them found
four records ahead of their code: D135's pack selector (planning only),
D134b's switching warning, D120's tax-inclusive display (`taxInclusive` is
stored and read by nothing) and D125's dimension-to-library mapping screen;
and two screens reachable only by URL (`/stock-takes`, `/products/barcodes`).

**Left as found.** Twelve `no-unused-vars` warnings in the API — eleven on
this branch before the merge, one theirs (`replacementValue` in the exchange
service); the cart store's hydrate effect reads `shopTz` outside its
dependency list, identical on both parents; prettier drift on lines each
side authored. None was introduced here.

### D136a — the four commits that followed, merged the same way

`origin/feature/retail-template` moved on by four commits the same day
(1887632 → 76ad3ac: the server refuses measured goods outside RETAIL,
D134e; a refunded or voided sale keeps its receipt and a void is stamped;
the SKU leaves the 80mm receipt and the A4 column defaults off for new
workspaces; the wizard's variations come from the attribute library,
D125). They were re-pulled and merged as a second merge commit.

**The same renumber, the same way.** The four were cherry-picked onto the
renumbered tip (`9c557af`) — two of them met the renumber commit on the
same comment lines and took the incoming text — and their twenty-three
references (D104 → D125, D104a → D125a, D109 → D130, D113c → D134c, D113e →
D134e) were moved in one commit on the temporary branch, which is the
merge's second parent. No migration, no schema, no decision-log change on
their side.

**No textual conflict; two of our specs pinned what they changed.** Git
auto-merged all fourteen files, six of which D136 had unioned by hand.
`product-availability.spec.ts` (D101) mocks the attributes service and
now also stubs the D134e gate; the D99 geometry round-trip in
`settings.service.spec.ts` used `showSku`'s default as its "untouched
field keeps its value" example — it now stores `true` first, which is the
value a flattening merge would actually lose. Both re-pointed at their
intent, neither weakened (D16, D30). The D10 column tripwire is unchanged.

**What a Tile Shop sees, for the record (D16).** Their 5.10 removes the SKU
line from the 80mm SALES receipt for every tenant — the return receipt
(`return-receipt.template.ts`) still prints it, so a refund slip now shows
what the sale slip hides — and moves the A4 SKU column's DEFAULT to off.
The settings service has written the whole documents object on every save
since its first version, so any tenant that ever saved its settings or
uploaded a logo keeps its column; only a workspace that never did loses
it, and the web's offline fallback profile still says `true`. Neither
change is covered by a decision record on their side — the commit calls it
"a deliberate product change" — and both reach the QuickBooks pilot.
Merged as written; flagged to the PO rather than reverted (O11). Their
reprint change is a fix, not a wording change: a fully returned Tile Shop
sale's receipt button has always rendered and now works. The VOID stamp is
dormant everywhere — nothing writes `Sale.status = 'VOIDED'` yet.

**What the review changed.** Four reviewers and two skeptics per finding
read the three-way diffs. Their commit cites a D134e that no branch ever
wrote; it is recorded above from the commit's own reasoning. Their
category-change reconciliation unmapped a dimension but left its options'
library links, exactly the shape the server refuses
(`ATTRIBUTE_LINK_INCOMPLETE`); the options now unlink with the dimension,
their names kept, asserted from both sides. Their DRAFT refusal comment
says the till no longer offers the button, but only the sale page was
gated — the sales list's reprint icon, whose handler swallows the
refusal, is now gated the same way. The API spec, the integration plan and
five catalogue rows that described the pre-D134e or pre-reprint behaviour
were re-pointed. Left as their design, for the PO: once a workspace has
any library definition, a pre-5.11 dimension renders as an unchosen
picker beside its typed options; and the create path runs the D134e gate
before the D134c unit check while the update path runs them the other
way round, so a hardware `DECIMAL` create with no unit is refused for the
domain and the same update for the unit.

### D137 — merging `fix/issues-restaurant`'s follow-up: an unbilled order is Unpaid

`origin/fix/issues-restaurant` moved on by one commit after D119
(`f6e45a6`, 2026-09-08): a restaurant order with no Sale of its own now
reports `paymentStatus: UNPAID` instead of `null`, the queue renders a
"Not tracked" badge where a row genuinely carries no payment state of ours
(a third-party order, a cancelled or draft one), and the products screen
gains the shared search normaliser, a Clear control and an accessible
name for its search box while its header loses the Categories button.
Seven files, no textual conflict, no migration, no reference to renumber.

**What the widening means.** Until now a Sale was written only at
settlement, so an order placed, cooked and handed over but never billed
carried no payment status — and the queue's Unpaid chip, an equality test
on that field, skipped exactly the orders somebody still has to chase. Their
change reads `UNPAID` as "nobody has taken the money yet"; `CANCELLED` and
`DRAFT` stay `null` because nothing was ever owed. The commit cites "D53"
for the narrower reading; this log holds no D53 record — D52 is followed
by D54, and no D53 heading ever existed in the history — and the narrower
reading lived only in the old code (`sale?.paymentStatus ?? null`). D52's
"a restaurant bill legitimately exists unpaid — `paymentStatus: UNPAID`
already records that" is about the Sale row and is not what was widened.
Nothing in D110, D117 or D119 reads `null` as "not yet billed", so no
consumer changes meaning; the derived field stays derived, and D117's
settled takeaway still reads from its Sale. The review found two places
their commit left behind: the order drawer still printed a bare dash where
the row now says "Not tracked" (both read the same badge now), and the
third-party projection's comment still promised a dash. A products render
test on our side never mocked the brands request the retail merge added;
it does now, so it no longer touches a live API.

**The products header.** Their commit drops the Categories button because
the inventory tabs above the list already carry a Categories tab to the
same route; the merged page still renders those tabs, so the screen stays
reachable for every business kind. The search box collapses runs of
whitespace the way Customers and Sales already do.

### D196 — merging `feature/retail-template-v2` again: the sixteen commits that followed

D173 merged that branch at `75b086d`. Sixteen more commits have landed since —
the receipt says what crossed the counter and uses the trade's words, the
tender is captured when it is true, a reprint keeps the tender it printed, the
import template is the tenant's, two retail workspaces are seeded from the
PO's real shops, a receipt number is unique per tenant, a document carries its
pictures, an exchange is a basket — recorded there as D162–D174.

**Migrations first, at the PO's request, and this one earned the attention.**
Their branch adds `20260917000000_scope_receipt_number_per_tenant`, which
shares its TIMESTAMP with D181's printing migration merged from another
branch. Both are safe on their own: theirs adds a nullable column, backfills
it from each receipt's own sale, sets NOT NULL only then, and swaps a global
unique for a per-tenant one — a loosening, which no existing row can violate.
The two touch disjoint tables, so their relative order is immaterial; Prisma
orders same-timestamp folders by full name, which puts `d181_` before `scope_`
deterministically. Neither had run anywhere when they met — not the dev
database, not production — so NEITHER folder was renamed. Proven by applying
theirs on top of the dev database's existing set and by the integration suite
replaying all 87 from scratch. The "drop the stray FK-drift migration" commit
in their log touched only docs; nothing on disk was removed.

**Numbering: two ranges, one pass.** The twelve records D173 merged were still
on their original D150–D161 on their side and moved by eleven again to land on
identical text; the thirteen new ones took D162–D174, every one spent here
(their own merged twelve, the last merge's record, the lane-counts fix), and
became D183–D195. Their thirteen arrived as `## ` headings like the twelve
before them and were normalised the same way.

**Six conflicts.** The schema and `package.json` were both sides adding one
line to the same spot; unioned. The migration tripwire had each side register
its own migration and bump 85 to 86; both listed, 87, confirmed by the spec
against the real directory. The payment page: D163 had hidden the print
toggle where there is no A4 and their D187 brings it back naming whichever
bill prints — the later decision on the same branch, taken. The catalogue and
the decision log were rebuilt record by record, as D180 did, rather than
resolved line by line; the four KIT rows both sides held keep D152's rewrite,
which is newer than the D147 text theirs still carried.

**Their branch deletes `temp/`, and the merge honours that.** Seventeen
scratch files including the seven receipt photographs this branch committed
under D149's merge; nothing in the repo referenced any of them, and their
commit says why. They remain reachable at `c3c316f`.

**One integration failure, and it was a real finding rather than a merge
defect.** The printing spec failed once in the full run and passed alone three
times. Its `waitFor` helper polled a dispatcher for four seconds and then
RETURNED SILENTLY, so a slow full-suite run surfaced as a downstream assertion
saying "expected 0 to be greater than 0" — true and useless. Two changes: the
helper now throws on timeout with its own name, and its budget is fifteen
seconds, which costs nothing on the happy path since it returns the moment the
check passes. Making it throw exposed one test that had been passing only
because the silent timeout let it: it used `waitFor(() => false, 500)` as a
half-second sleep to prove a second bill is NOT printed. That intent now has
its own helper, `drainFor`, so a negative wait cannot be mistaken for a
positive one that gave up.

Verified rather than assumed, as in every merge since D158: every file only
they changed is byte-identical to their branch, every file only this branch
changed is byte-identical to here, no decision heading appears twice, both
tripwires pass, D151's removals and D177's wording hold.

Gates on the merged tree: typecheck 8/8, api unit 1629 across 101 suites, web
unit 1669 across 121 files (2 skipped), integration 1232 across 58 suites from
a fresh database, run twice, lint 0 errors (12 warnings, all pre-existing).
Playwright not run — it needs a live stack.

### D195 — the refund slip gets the logo too

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-14. No schema change, no migration.

### What was reported

> "return/refund bill also needed to contain the bussiness logo"

### What D193 missed

D193 put the logo on the **sales** receipt and the **A4** letterhead and stopped
there. `return-receipt.template.ts` is a separate renderer with its own data
shape, and it was not in the diff.

That is the wrong one to have missed. A refund slip is handed to a customer who
is already unhappy, and it is the document they keep as proof the shop took the
goods back — the piece of paper most likely to be brought back in and argued
over.

The A4 return document was already covered, because `returnHtml` goes through
the same `render()` boundary D193 introduced. Only the thermal slip was left.

### The decision

**Same field, same contract, same rules.** `logoDataUri` on
`ReturnReceiptData`, inlined by `ReturnsService` from the **same**
`documents.logoUrl` the bill and the letterhead read.

One shop, one logo. A per-document setting is how a refund slip ends up showing
a different mark from the bill it reverses.

The logo sits **above** the shop name and does not replace it, for D193's
reason and one of its own: a customer disputing a refund needs the slip to say
which shop owes them the money, and a monochrome roll can turn a colour logo
into a smear.

### Mutation proof

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| drop the `if (!d.logoDataUri) return ''` guard | "prints no image at all when no logo is configured" **and** "treats an explicit null the same as an absent logo" |
| the logo REPLACES the shop name | "prints the logo as inlined bytes when one is configured" |

The template had **no spec at all** before this. The new one also pins what the
header must not disturb: the refund total, the return and sale numbers, the
document type, and the `RETURN / REFUND` stamp — which is the loudest thing on
the page deliberately, because a refund slip mistaken for a sales receipt is one
that can be presented as proof of purchase.

### Now fully covered

Every server-rendered document carries its branding: the sales bill (D193), the
A4 letterhead, invoice, quotation and return (D193), and the refund slip
(D195). The only printable left without one is `receipt-print.ts`'s
**client-side fallback**, recorded in D193 and still deliberate: it exists to
get paper out of the printer when the API is unreachable, and its whole design
is to be minimal.

### D194 — an exchange is a basket, not a line

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-14. No schema change, no migration,
**no server change at all**.

### What was reported

> "in here if i want to exchange all product on sales it cant do i have to do
> one by one thats not right. lets say i bought 3 products i want to exchange 2
> so i needed that option"

### What was actually restricting it

Four limits, stacked, and **every one of them lived in a single web page**:

| | Limit | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | one returned line — `<input type="radio">` over a single `chosenSaleItemId` | UI |
| 2 | one replacement — a single `replacementVariantId` | UI |
| 3 | the replacement had to be another variant of the **same product** | UI |
| 4 | the whole line always came back — `returnQuantity: availableReturnQuantity` | UI |

The server had none of them. `CompleteExchangeDto` declares

```ts
returnItems!: ReturnItemInputDto[];        // ArrayMinSize(1), no maximum
replacementItems!: SaleItemInputDto[];     // any productId, any variant
```

and `ExchangesService` contains no same-product check — it builds a `Return` and
a `Sale`, both of which have held many lines since they existed. `7.5` shipped
the thinnest visible path deliberately and said so in the page's own header:
*"multi-line exchanges … out of scope by agreement"*.

That agreement did not survive contact with a shop. Served one at a time, a
customer swapping two of three items produces **two exchange numbers, two
returns and two replacement sales** for one visit to the counter.

### The decision

**Limits 1, 2 and 4 are closed. Limit 3 stays, for now.**

The operator ticks every line coming back, says how many of each where a line
was bought more than once, and picks a replacement per line. Cross-product
swaps — a shirt for a tie — need a product search in the replacement step and
their own answer to what the refund is measured against; the server already
permits it, so it is a UI gap and is recorded as one rather than presented as a
rule.

### Approval is evaluated on the whole basket, once

This is the part that is more than convenience. The screen previews through
`POST /exchanges/preview` with **every** selected line, so the refund total and
the approval verdict are the ones the completion will produce.

Served as two exchanges, each could pass a cashier's per-refund limit that the
combined basket exceeds. One basket, one verdict, decided on the server — the
same reasoning D130 used when it moved the exchange waiver out of the screen.

### The rules left the screen

`selectedLines`, `everyLineAnswered`, `replacementTotal`, `toReturnItems`,
`toReplacementItems`, `clampQuantity` — all pure, all in
`lib/exchange-basket.ts`, the shape `product-presentation.ts` and
`catalogue-labels.ts` already keep.

Multi-line turns "which line" into real decisions: which lines are in, how many
of each, whether every one has an answer, what the customer pays. **A decision
made inside JSX is a decision nobody can test without a browser.** The page now
reads these; it does not restate them, which is what makes the tests below
guard the shipped path rather than a copy of it.

### Three rules worth naming

- **The selection is driven by the SALE, not by the choices.** A choice for a
  line the sale no longer offers — returned in another tab, or the sale
  refetched — must not survive as a phantom row. Mutation-proven.
- **`quantity: 0` deselects; it does not delete.** Ticking a line off and back
  on keeps the replacement already chosen for it.
- **An unanswered line contributes NOTHING to the total**, never the returned
  line's price. A half-filled basket showing a plausible figure is how an
  operator takes the wrong money.

And `toReplacementItems` **throws** rather than skipping a line with no
replacement. It cannot fire behind `everyLineAnswered`; the alternative would
send a basket that refunds three things and sells two — balanced on the screen,
short at the till.

### Mutation proof

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| `everyLineAnswered` without its `length > 0` guard | "is false for an empty basket" |
| `toReplacementItems` drops unanswered lines instead of throwing | "refuses to build a leg that would silently drop a line" |
| the selection is driven by `choices` instead of the sale's lines | "ignores a choice for a line the sale no longer offers" **and** "keeps the order of the sale" |

The first is the vacuity guard: `[].every(...)` is `true`, so without it a
screen with nothing ticked offers a Complete button that submits an exchange of
nothing.

The payload tests assert the two legs as exact **ordered** sets, and assert
they line up entry for entry. Counting them would pass for a basket that
refunded the shirt and sold a replacement for the trousers.

### D193 — a document carries its pictures, it does not point at them

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-14. No schema change, no migration.

### What was reported

> "bill not contain the logo of our business … and also quatation A4 bill also
> not containing the logo"

One sentence, two entirely different faults.

### Fault 1 — the A4 rendered the logo, as a broken image

`document-templates.ts` had been emitting it all along:

```ts
const logo = s.logoUrl ? `<img src="${esc(s.logoUrl)}" alt="${esc(s.name)}" />` : '';
```

`s.logoUrl` is `/uploads/<key>` — a path with **no origin**, deliberately, so
that switching storage backends does not invalidate stored rows. That is correct
inside the app's own pages, where the browser is already talking to the API.

It is wrong in a document. The API builds the HTML and the web app writes it
into a popup:

```ts
win.document.write(html)   // origin: the WEB app, :3000
```

so the image is requested from the **web app**, which has never heard of it.
Measured against the running stack:

```
http://localhost:4000/uploads/products/9384b575….webp  →  302
http://localhost:3000/uploads/products/9384b575….webp  →  404
```

The `<img>` was always there. The picture never was.

**The sales A4 does not have this bug**, which is why it was not reported: it is
a React component that calls `resolveImageUrl()` and prefixes the API origin.
One logo, two renderers, only one of them absolutising — and the one that did
not is the one used for quotations.

**The signature and the stamp had the identical defect**, on the same
letterhead, unreported only because fewer tenants have uploaded one. Fixed with
the logo; a fix that left two of three broken would print a letterhead with one
picture and two broken icons.

### Fault 2 — the thermal bill had no logo at all

`receipt-templates.ts` contained zero references to one, and
`CustomerReceiptData` had `storeName` and no image field. Never built. The bill
printed the shop's name as text, which is why it looked like a rendering
failure rather than a missing feature.

### The decision

**The bytes travel with the document.** Branding images are read once and
inlined as `data:` URIs.

Absolutising the URL against the API's origin would have fixed the popup and
nothing else. A quotation is **shared** — printed to PDF, attached to an email,
sent over WhatsApp — and a recipient's browser resolving `http://localhost:4000`
finds their own machine. A document that needs the issuing server to still be
reachable is not a document; it is a screen. Inlined, it prints, saves, forwards
and opens on a machine that has never heard of this installation.

`inline-image.ts` handles both provider shapes behind `StorageService.resolve`:
`local` gives a path on disk, `s3` gives a short-lived signed URL this process
fetches exactly as a browser would. Neither caller knows which is configured.

### It never throws, and that is a decision

Every failure path returns `null`, which the templates already render as "no
image" — the state of every tenant before anyone uploads a logo. A branding
asset is **decoration**; a quotation that 500s because a logo moved is a worse
outcome than one that prints without it, and a receipt is the record of money
that has already changed hands. Asserted directly: with storage unreachable,
both the bill and the letterhead still print, with the business name and the
totals intact.

### Two limits, chosen

- **512 KB cap.** `saveImage` downscales and re-encodes every upload, so a real
  logo lands far under it; the cap is for rows written before that pipeline
  existed. Base64 costs a third on top, and a 5 MB image inlined into every
  receipt would make the printer the slowest part of the sale.
- **Cached per stored path**, five minutes. A till prints all day, and
  re-reading the logo per receipt is the difference between a cached string and
  a round trip to S3 at the counter. Keyed per path, asserted negatively, so the
  stamp's bytes cannot be served as the logo.

### On the thermal bill, the name stays

The logo sits **above** the shop name; it does not replace it. A roll is 80mm
and **monochrome** — a colour image dithers, and a logo that prints as a grey
smear on a bill carrying no shop name is worse than no logo. Sized with
`max-height: 18mm`, in millimetres because the output is paper.

That trade-off was put to the Product Owner before it was built. Whether a given
logo survives thermal printing is a property of the artwork, not of this code:
high-contrast line art prints, photographs do not.

### Mutation proof

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| drop the `if (!d.logoDataUri) return ''` guard | "prints no image at all when no logo is configured" **and** "prints the bill without the logo when the image cannot be read" |
| the logo REPLACES the shop name | "prints the logo as inlined bytes when one is configured" |

The second is the one worth having. It only fails because the positive case
asserts the shop name is present **alongside** the logo — a test that merely
looked for the image would have passed a bill with no shop name on it.

The A4 cases assert a `data:` URI **and** the absence of any `/uploads/` src.
Asserting an `<img>` exists would have passed against the broken version, which
emitted one all along.

### Known limit

`receipt-print.ts` keeps a **client-side fallback** that prints a minimal
receipt when the server render fails. It has no logo and is not given one: it
exists to get paper out of the printer when the API is unreachable, and its
whole design is to be minimal. Recorded so it is not mistaken for an oversight.

### D192 — a receipt number is unique per tenant, not per installation

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-14. **Schema change and migration**
`20260917000000_scope_receipt_number_per_tenant`.

### The defect

`Receipt.receiptNumber` was `String @unique` — globally, across every tenant in
the installation. The value is built in one place:

```ts
`RCP-${sale.saleNumber}`
```

and `Sale` is `@@unique([tenantId, saleNumber])`. **Every tenant's numbering
restarts at S-000001.**

So the first tenant to print claimed `RCP-S-000001` for the whole installation,
and every other tenant printing its own first sale hit a `P2002` that surfaced
as a **hard 500 at the till** — on a path with no workaround, since a receipt is
the record of money that has already changed hands.

Not theoretical. On the development database when this was found:

| `saleNumber` | tenants holding it | receipts printed |
|---|---|---|
| `S-000001` | **4** | **1** |
| `S-000002` | **4** | **1** |
| `S-000003` | **4** | **1** |

Three tenants out of four could not print a receipt for their own first sale,
today, on the machine this was written on. D191 made it likelier rather than
less likely: four seeded workspaces instead of two.

### The decision

**`@@unique([tenantId, receiptNumber])`, with a `tenantId` column to hang it
on.**

`InventoryReceipt` — the sibling model, same field name, same purpose for
purchases — has carried exactly that pair since it was introduced. This brings
`Receipt` into line rather than inventing a shape.

### Why not simply drop the constraint

It was tempting. `receiptNumber` is **never a lookup key**: every query in
`ReceiptsRepository` reaches a receipt by `saleId` or `id`, scoped with
`sale: { tenantId }`. And uniqueness per tenant is already implied by
construction — `Receipt.saleId` is `@unique`, `Sale` is unique per
`(tenantId, saleNumber)`, and the number is derived from the sale number.

Dropping it would have been a one-line migration with no new column.

It was rejected because **implied is not enforced**. The number a customer is
handed is an identifier; the moment anything else derives a receipt number — a
reprint path, an import, a correction — the implication stops holding and
nothing catches it. The guarantee is cheap to state and the mutation proof below
shows what its absence costs: with no constraint at all, four of the five tests
still pass.

### Why `tenantId` is denormalised onto `Receipt`

A composite unique needs both columns on the table; `sale.tenantId` cannot be
reached from an index. The column is written **on create and never on update**,
deliberately: a receipt belongs to the tenant of its sale and a sale never
changes hands, so putting `tenantId` in the `upsert`'s `update` branch would let
a *reprint* move a receipt between tenants — a worse bug than the one being
fixed. A test asserts the column agrees with the sale it hangs off.

### Migration safety

Additive then narrowing, in the only order safe on a populated table:

1. `ADD COLUMN "tenantId" TEXT` — nullable, so existing rows stay legal;
2. backfill each receipt from **its own sale**;
3. `SET NOT NULL`;
4. drop the global unique, create the composite, add the index and the FK.

No row moves between tenants: each receipt takes the tenant it was already
reachable through. `Receipt.saleId` is NOT NULL and `@unique`, so the backfill
covers every row and cannot produce two answers for one receipt.

The narrowing cannot fail on existing data, because **the old constraint was
strictly stronger than the new one**: anything globally unique is unique within
a tenant. A migration that loosens a constraint has no data to reject.

### Blast radius on hardware and restaurant: zero

Asserted, not assumed:

- **The receipt number format is unchanged.** `RCP-${sale.saleNumber}` is
  untouched, so every existing receipt keeps the string it was printed with and
  a reprint renders byte-for-byte what it rendered before.
- **No rendering code changed.** `receipt-templates.ts` is not in the diff. Its
  55 assertions pass unmodified.
- **No existing assertion was weakened.** One line moved in
  `receipts.service.spec.ts` — `mock.calls[0][2]` became `[3]`, because
  `tenantId` is now the first argument. The assertions either side of it are
  identical, and the index was *supposed* to shift: had it not, the spec would
  have silently begun reading the receipt number instead of the content.
- **Both domains verified against real PostgreSQL**, not by inspection: the full
  integration suite, which exercises hardware QuickBooks receipts and restaurant
  bills end to end.

The only behaviour that changes is the one that was broken: a second tenant
printing its own sale N now succeeds instead of returning 500.

#### What the blast-radius check turned up, and did not

Running the integration suite for this found **two red specs that predate
D192**: `no-accounting-documents.spec.ts` still matched `/Balance/i` against a
thermal bill that has said `Bal. Amount` since D188 renamed the rows. D188 did
not catch them because the **integration suite was not run** — the unit suite is
green either way, and those two only fail against a real PostgreSQL and a real
rendered document.

They are recorded here rather than buried because they are the honest answer to
"was the blast radius zero": the check found something, it was not this change,
and the distinction is verifiable — D192's diff contains no rendering code, and
`receipt-templates.ts` is not in it. Fixed in their own commit, with the
assertions strengthened rather than merely re-pointed: `Bal. Amount` alone would
pass for a bill printing an empty row.

The lesson is about cadence, not about either change. A rename shipped with a
decision record still slipped past, because the suite that could see it is the
one nobody runs on a normal day.

### Mutation proof

`receipt-number-tenant-scope.spec.ts` runs against real PostgreSQL, because the
defect lives in an **index**, not a branch — a mocked Prisma raises whatever the
mock is told to raise and would have passed against the broken schema and the
fixed one alike.

Two mutations were applied to the live test database and the suite re-run:

| Mutation | Result |
|---|---|
| restore the global `@unique` on `receiptNumber` | **2 failed** — "both tenants print their own S-000001" and "a receipt belongs to the tenant of its sale", with the original `Unique constraint failed on the fields: (receiptNumber)` |
| drop the composite unique and add nothing | **1 failed** — "a duplicate within one tenant is still refused" |

The second is the one that matters for test design. Four of five tests pass with
**no constraint at all**, so the positive case alone would have green-lit
removing the guarantee entirely. That is why the negative case is written.

### The tripwire had to be told

`provider-contract.spec.ts` pins the migration directories as an **exact set**,
so a new migration fails it until someone names it and says why. That is the
test working, not the test being in the way, and it is the reason the reasoning
above now sits beside the directory name in the spec. The count moved 85 → 86.

### D191 — the demo shops are the Product Owner's shops, exported not invented

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-14. No schema change, no migration.
Supersedes the `retail-demo` tenant from [D190](#d169).

### What was reported

> "we needed to do like resturant and hardware to retail grocery and clothing …
> i have data of grocery and retail and i can login … but others cant login to
> my clothing store and grocery"

and, on the seeder D190 had wired up:

> "why you create a clothing.ts file others dont use that kind of file"

### Two things were wrong, and only one of them was the one reported

**D190 seeded one retail tenant. There are two trades.** `RETAIL` covers
clothing and grocery, and they exercise opposite halves of the catalogue:
clothing sells a variant chain (Size × Colour, a barcode and a stock row each),
grocery sells by weight (`DECIMAL` quantity, `kg` and `L`). A single demo tenant
can only ever show one of them, and a developer reviewing grocery work inside a
clothing shop is reviewing nothing.

**D190 pointed the seeder at `seed-packs/clothing.ts`, which is the wrong file.**
That is the **provisioning starter kit** (D120) — five empty categories and two
token products, deliberately thin because a real shop deletes whatever we
invent. Wiring the demo tenant to it produced a two-product workspace where the
Product Owner had built twenty. The objection was right, though not for the
reason given: `clothing.ts` was not written for this, and a separate data file
is in fact the existing hardware pattern (`mock-catalog.ts`).

### The decision

**A demo workspace carries the catalogue somebody actually built, exported from
the app, not a stand-in written to resemble one.**

| | `clothing-demo` | `grocery-demo` |
|---|---|---|
| Name | Kandy Apparel | Colombo Grocery Mart |
| Products | 16 | 6 |
| Variants | 44 | 9 |
| Sold by | the piece | **weight** — `DECIMAL`, `kg` and `L` |

The point is that a teammate opens the shop the PO is describing in the message
they just sent. A plausible invented catalogue cannot do that: it is right in
shape and wrong in every particular, which is worse than empty because it looks
finished.

### Three files, three jobs

| File | Job | Hand-edited? |
|---|---|---|
| `src/mock-clothing.ts`, `src/mock-grocery.ts` | **data** | never — generated |
| `src/catalogue-pack.ts` | **behaviour**: apply a pack to a tenant | yes, once |
| `prisma/export-catalogue.ts` | **the generator** | yes, once |

This is `mock-catalog.ts`'s split, extended for variants. Hardware could keep
its data in one flat file because a hardware product is a row; a clothing
product is a row plus dimensions plus options plus a variant per combination
plus a stock row per variant, so the data needed a richer shape and the writing
needed a function. A bug in `seedCatalogue` is fixed once for every pack.

`seed-packs/clothing.ts` is **not** replaced. It keeps its D120 job: what a
brand-new shop is provisioned with. The two are opposite by design — a starter
kit should be thin because a real shop clears it out, and a demo should look
like a shop that has been trading.

### The packs carry no ids, deliberately

Every lookup in `seedCatalogue` is by the key a human would use — a category's
name, a product's SKU, a dimension's name. Ids are generated, so a pack cannot
carry one, and a pack that did would only apply to the database that made it.
That is precisely the bug this decision exists to fix, so it must not reappear
inside the fix.

It is also what makes a re-seed converge: rename a seeded product in the app and
the next seed matches its SKU and renames it back, rather than creating a second
product beside it.

### Why `seedRetailShop` can return `null`

`Tenant.slug` is globally `@unique`, and the PO's own hand-made workspace holds
`grocery-demo` on their machine. Creating the seeded tenant there raises `P2002`
and takes the whole seed down — on the one machine whose database matters most.

Both alternatives were worse:

- **Rename their tenant to claim the slug.** D190 already refused this: it takes
  someone's work hostage to a convention.
- **Adopt the row and write into it.** The seed would then overwrite a workspace
  someone is actively using.

So the seed **stands aside**, says plainly that the slug is spoken for, and
seeds nothing. Verified: the holding tenant came through with zero rows written
into it. On every teammate's machine and in CI nothing holds the slug and both
workspaces are created normally.

### Two defects the fresh-database test caught

Neither was reachable from the author's database, which is the argument for
seeding from **empty** rather than re-running against a database that already
has the answer.

**1. Two default variants.** `ProductVariant_productId_default_key` is a
**partial** unique index:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX ... ON "ProductVariant" ("productId") WHERE ("isDefault" = true)
```

Prisma cannot express a partial index, so the schema does not declare it and
nothing in the type system stops a second default. The applier asked each
variant in turn *"are you the declared default, or are you index 0?"*, which
made both true, and it failed as a `P2002` naming `productId` — which reads like
a duplicate **product**. Now decided once per product, and every variant is
written not-default before the winner is promoted, so a re-seed that moves the
default never holds two at once.

**2. The applier invented a default that the source never stated.** Every
product in both shops has **no** default variant; the index forbids two, not
zero. Falling back to "index 0 wins" made the seeded shop differ from the real
one. A pack that invents is a pack that cannot be trusted to reproduce the shop
it came from, so a product with no declared default now gets none.

### Verification

Seeded into a **database created empty**, migrations forward, then compared
against the source workspaces field by field: name, SKU, type, description,
prices, cost, category, subcategory, brand, `quantityType`, unit of measure,
reorder level, `attributes`, and per variant the SKU, barcode, prices,
`isDefault`, every option value and the stock quantity.

- **16/16 and 6/6 products match exactly**, by SET and not by count — equal
  totals is the standard way a comparison passes while holding different rows.
- **Run twice** — identical, and still an exact match.
- **Negative control**: the two shops share **0** product keys. A comparison
  that matched everything would pass the positive test too.
- The comparison **throws** if the source holds no products, so it cannot pass
  by inspecting nothing.

One difference during the first run turned out not to be a defect: a shirt read
21 in the pack and 19 in the source. `StockMovement` showed a real sale of 2
units at `2026-09-14 05:21`, after the export ran. The exporter was right and
the live shop had moved under it.

### The staff are the PO's too, not a house style

> "but here i use `owner@kandyapparel.test` and then other team mates get
> another email ???"

The first cut seeded `clothing.owner@axlopos.test`, matching the restaurant's
naming. It read tidily and was wrong in the way that matters: the PO demos with
`owner@kandyapparel.test`, so the team would have been handed a different
address for the same shop and **"use my login" stopped being true the moment it
was written down**. The whole decision is about a teammate opening the shop the
PO is describing; handing them a different door undoes it.

So the seeded staff are the source workspaces' staff, names included — Nimal
Perera and Sanduni Silva in clothing, and the grocery pair. Safe because
`@@unique([tenantId, email])` is per **tenant**: the PO's own hand-made
workspace and the seeded one hold the same address without colliding.

They are also **branch-scoped**, matching the source. The hardware and
restaurant owners are branch-less because those tenants are modelled as
multi-branch; a one-shop retailer signs in at their shop, and an owner with no
branch has no register to open a till on.

The password is the seed's own (`Retail123!`, documented in `README.md` and
never echoed). A bcrypt hash cannot be read back, so the PO's local password
could not have been carried even in principle — and a teammate needs a
documented credential rather than one they have to be told privately.

### Excluded, not deleted

Four experiments sat in the clothing workspace — `Test` (25 variants, a third of
the whole catalogue), `Test-2`, `Test-3` and `Scaff`. The instruction was to
delete them and re-export.

They are not inert. `Test-3` carries **twelve sale lines and four quotation
lines**; `Scaff` five sales; `Test` two sales and twenty-seven stock movements.
And the foreign keys are not uniform:

| Reference | On delete |
|---|---|
| `SaleItem.productId` | **SET NULL** |
| `QuotationItem.productId` | **SET NULL** |
| `StockMovement.productId` | **CASCADE** |
| `BranchInventory`, `ProductVariant` | CASCADE |
| `ReturnItem.productId` | RESTRICT |

So deleting them would not have failed — it would have succeeded and quietly
orphaned nineteen sale lines and four quotation lines, and destroyed fifty stock
movements, in the Product Owner's own traded-in workspace.

`--exclude` was added instead. It keeps a product out of the **pack** and
deletes nothing. The team gets a catalogue with no `Test-3` in it, which was the
entire point, and the author's trading history is untouched. It reports which
names matched and warns about any that did not, so a typo in the flag is visible
rather than a silently larger catalogue.

Matched by NAME rather than SKU, because the products worth excluding are
reliably the ones nobody bothered to give a SKU.

### Still not carried

Sales history, customers, suppliers, quotations and promotions. A pack is a
**catalogue**. Seeding a tenant's trading history would freeze one shop's
invoice numbers into every developer's database, and the numbers would be wrong
the moment anyone rang up a sale.

### D190 — a workspace the team can sign in to is a seeded workspace

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-11. No schema change, no migration.

### What was reported

> "other users cant see my retail account when i give them my credential
> created they cant visit it , they say needed to add it to … seed.ts"

### What was actually wrong

Nothing was wrong with the credentials. `seed.ts` seeded **three** tenants
— `tnt_dev` (HARDWARE), `tnt_resto` (RESTAURANT) and `tnt_platform` — and
**no RETAIL tenant at all**. The retail workspace everyone had been demoing in
was created by hand on one machine through `provision-tenant` / the platform
console, so it lives in one developer's database and nowhere else.

A password is an answer to "who are you", not to "does this row exist". Handing
it to a teammate whose database has no such tenant fails at the lookup, before
authentication is ever reached. **Sharing a credential cannot share a row.**

### The decision

**Every workspace the team is expected to sign in to is seeded. A workspace
created by hand is a workspace that exists on one machine.**

So `seedRetail()` joins `seedRestaurant()` and `seedPlatformConsole()`:
`retail-demo`, profile `RETAIL` · `LOCAL` inventory · `NONE` accounting, an
Owner and a Cashier, and the clothing pack.

The hand-made tenant is **not** migrated or renamed. It keeps its data and its
owner keeps working in it; the seeded one is simply the workspace the team
shares. Renaming someone's tenant to claim the slug would take their work
hostage to a convention.

### Clothing, and with samples

`seedClothingPack` is **the same function `provision-tenant` calls** for a real
RETAIL workspace (D120), not a second catalogue written for the demo. Shared
deliberately: the workspace a developer reviews in and the workspace a shop is
given must not be able to drift apart.

Clothing rather than groceries because Q12 kept RETAIL as one business type, and
clothing is what exercises the parts retail actually added — variants across
Size and Colour (D44), the per-variant stock the till reads (D121), and business
details the tenant owns (D161).

`withSamples: true` here, where `provision-tenant` defaults it **off**. D120's
reasoning is about a real shop: seeded products are frozen in that shop's
database and someone then has to clear them out. This tenant exists to be looked
at, and a demo workspace with no products shows nothing. Verified: 5 categories,
2 products, **16 variants**, each with a barcode, and 16 branch-inventory rows
totalling 144 units.

### No role wiring, and that is the point

The restaurant needs three explicit `role.findFirst` + `user.update` blocks,
because `WAITER`, `KITCHEN_STAFF` and `RESTAURANT_CASHIER` have no matching
`UserRole` enum value and `linkUsersToRoles` links only where the key matches.

RETAIL uses `GENERAL_ROLE_TEMPLATES` — `Owner` and `Cashier` — whose keys
**are** enum values, so the generic linker handles both. Adding the explicit
blocks anyway would have been dead code that looked load-bearing. Proven rather
than assumed: after seeding, both users resolve a role **row**, and the cashier's
login returns `roleName: "Cashier"` with 17 permissions.

### What is deliberately not written

- **No business details.** D161 makes them a tenant *override*; `schemaFor`
  falls back to RETAIL's shipped fields when there is none. Restating Material /
  Fit / Care instructions / Gender / Season in the seed would freeze today's
  list into this tenant and silently stop tracking the domain.
- **No `TenantModule` rows**, for `provision-tenant`'s own reason: with a profile
  and no per-module opinion the API resolves the defaults for the business type,
  and writing them would freeze today's defaults.
- **The timezone IS written**, matching `provision-tenant`. It equals
  `DEFAULT_TIME_ZONE`, so nothing renders differently today; what the row buys is
  that the setting is *stated* rather than inherited, so a later change to the
  default cannot silently re-date this tenant.

### Verification

Idempotent by construction — every write is an upsert, the settings row is
guarded by a lookup because `(tenantId, branchId)` carries no unique index, and
the pack matches categories by name. The seed was run against a database that
already held the hand-made tenant: `tnt_retail` appeared, and `kandy-apparel`
came through unchanged at 20 products and 2 users.

End to end, against the running API: `POST /v1/auth/login` with
`workspace: retail-demo` returns **200** for both users, resolving `tnt_retail`,
branch `Main Store` and register `Counter 1`.

### The seed console does not print the password

Same rule the restaurant follows: it points at the README's table instead.
Echoing a credential to a terminal is how it reaches scrollback, CI logs and
screenshots.

### D189 — the import template is the tenant's, not a fixed fourteen columns

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-11. No schema change, no migration.

### What was reported

> "in product there is a import button to download the template and upload it,
> but template was little bit wrong now after the changes … because we add
> business details from settings"

### What was wrong

`TEMPLATE_HEADERS` was a fixed list of the fourteen QuickBooks *Products &
Services* columns, written long before D161. D161 made the catalogue's
descriptive fields **the tenant's own**, so a clothing shop that configured
Material, Fit, Care instructions, Gender and Season could set them one product
at a time in the wizard — and **not at all** in a sheet of four hundred.

`buildTemplate()` did not even take a `tenantId`. It could not have known.

### The decision

**The template is generated per tenant: the fourteen QuickBooks columns, then
one column per configured business detail, under the tenant's own label.**

- A **hardware** workspace configures none, so its sheet is byte-for-byte the
  one it has always downloaded. Asserted directly, because that is the file
  another team's operators use.
- The example rows gain a plausible value per field type, so the expected shape
  is visible rather than described.
- The parser reads those columns back into `attributes`, **keyed by the field's
  `key`, not its label**: the label is what a human types in a spreadsheet, the
  key is what the product stores.

### Validation is the API's own, not a second copy

Each row's details are checked with `validateAttributes` — the same function
`assertValidDocument` refuses with. So "Fit must be one of Regular, Slim,
Relaxed, Oversized" is written once, and a sheet's error cannot drift from the
endpoint's.

It runs where the value will actually be applied:

| Row | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **create** | always validated — a missing required field is an error the operator sees while reviewing, not at row 12 of the commit |
| **update**, columns filled | validated, and written |
| **update**, columns blank | **nothing is sent** |

That last row is the one that matters. D64 gives the attributes document
**replace** semantics: `{}` means "this product has no business details", so an
import that sent an empty object for a row whose columns were blank would
**erase** what the product holds. `undefined` and `{}` look alike in a debugger
and are opposite instructions; a sheet that ignores those columns must leave
them alone.

### Still not carried by the import

`brandId` (D133), `quantityType` / `unitOfMeasure` (D134) and barcodes have no
column either. They were out of scope here and are listed so the gap is
recorded rather than rediscovered: this decision closes the one the PO reported.

### Mutation proof

Five mutations, each failing the case that carries its decision:

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| the template ignores the tenant's fields (**the reported bug**) | "appends one column per configured field" |
| columns keyed by LABEL instead of key | "keyed by field key not label" |
| a blank update sends `{}` | "an UPDATE whose columns are blank sends NOTHING" |
| commit drops the attributes again | "carries the attributes through commit" |
| the per-row validation is skipped | the bad-value case and the required-field case |

The template is asserted by **reading the workbook back**, not by inspecting the
array handed to ExcelJS: a column that exists in a variable and never reaches
the file is exactly the defect class here.

### A worked example ships with it

`Docs/product-import-example-clothing.xlsx` — ten products for a clothing shop,
covering all three item types and every business-detail field. It was verified
by running it through the **real** `preview` parser (10 rows, no errors), not by
eye.

### D188 — the receipt uses the trade's words, not correct English

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-11. Display only. No schema change,
no migration, no behaviour change.

### What was asked

> "for the thermal bills need a little change in raw names in bill
> Total → Bill Amount, Cash → Paid Amount, Balance → Bal. Amount
> because it is the standed way, in restaurant bill also use this way"

### Checked before changing

`thermal-bill.ts` — the food-service renderer, written long before this branch —
prints exactly:

```
Bill Amount : …
Paid Amount : …
Bal. Amount : …
```

So the PO is describing what half the product already does. The retail receipt
said `Total` / `Paid` / `Balance`: correct English, and not what a till roll
says in this market. A customer handed a slip should not have to work out that
two shops mean the same thing by different words.

### The decision

The retail customer receipt adopts the restaurant renderer's three labels.

| Was | Now |
|---|---|
| `Total` | **`Bill Amount`** |
| `Paid` (ordinary) / `Cash` (over-tender) | **`Paid Amount`** |
| `Balance` | **`Bal. Amount`** |

**The payment BREAKDOWN keeps its method names.** `Cash`, `Card`, `Credit`
there name how the sale was settled, not an amount, and renaming those would
turn a method into a total.

**One gain beyond consistency:** both layouts now read identically. D185's
four-row over-tender layout and the ordinary one carry the same three labels,
so a cashier is not learning two receipts.

**The ` :` suffix is NOT copied.** The restaurant renderer appends a colon to
each label; this receipt puts one on none of its other rows (Subtotal, Tax,
Status), and three colons among seven rows reads worse than none.

### Consequence for the tests, worth recording

Both layouts now share labels, so several assertions that told them apart by
WORD no longer can. Those were rewritten to discriminate by what actually
differs:

- the figure's **count** (the over-tender layout prints the total once; the old
  one printed it three times);
- the **payment breakdown**, which the ordinary layout keeps and the short one
  drops;
- the **value** in a shared row (`Paid Amount` is the tender in one layout and
  the settled amount in the other).

One case lost its teeth in the rename and was caught by re-running the
mutations: "prints neither when the customer paid the exact amount" passed
against a receipt that had wrongly taken the short path, because after the
rename both layouts print `Paid Amount 2,478` and `Bal. Amount 0.00`. It now
asserts the breakdown is present, which is the only thing that still separates
them.

### D187 — a till that prints one bill offers one bill

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-11. Frontend only. No schema change,
no migration.

### What was reported

> "when cacheir giving bill its needed to show only thermal bill, only in
> quotations we use A4 bill. after click complete payment its go to thermal bill
> print like in restaurant-pos"

On a RETAIL till, completing a sale opened a dialog whose **primary** action was
**Print A4 Bill**, beside **Preview A4 Bill** — for a document D163 removed from
retail — with the receipt demoted to a text link between them. And with the A4
gone, `printAfter` had nothing to print, so a retail sale completed and printed
**nothing at all**.

### What D163 missed

D163 gated the Settings screen, the sale page and the *"print A4 bill after
payment"* toggle on `showA4SaleDocument`. Three doors, closed.

The fourth was the payment-complete dialog, and it is the one the cashier
actually stands in front of. The page **already computed** `canPrintA4` and used
it twice; it simply never passed it to the dialog.

### The decision

**One capability, three consequences.**

1. **The dialog offers the bill this workspace issues.** Where there is no A4,
   the receipt is the single, primary action — not a link between two buttons
   for a document that cannot be printed.
2. **`printAfter` chooses instead of refusing.** It read
   `printAfter && canPrintA4`, so retail printed nothing. It now prints the A4
   where there is one and the receipt where there is not.
3. **The toggle comes back, renamed.** D163 hid it because there was no A4 to
   print. There is still a receipt, and now that it prints automatically the
   operator needs the switch that turns it off. It reads *"Print A4 bill after
   payment"* or *"Print receipt after payment"*.

Hardware and every other A4 workspace are unchanged: same two buttons, same
toggle wording, same auto-print.

### Two implementation notes

**The auto-print is safe after an `await`.** D78 prints receipts from a hidden
iframe rather than a popup, so there is no transient-activation window to miss —
unlike the A4 path, which D74 had to open in the click's own turn.

**It uses the local `sale`, `ctx` and `tender`, not the state just set.** React
has not re-rendered at that point, and reading state a beat too early is exactly
the D184 defect.

### `SuccessView` moved out of `page.tsx`

Next's App Router forbids extra named exports from a route file, so the dialog
could not be rendered by a test while it lived there. It is now
`components/pos/payment-success-dialog.tsx`. That is why this defect survived
D163: **nothing had ever rendered this page**, so no test could see which
buttons it drew.

### Mutation proof

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| the dialog ignores the flag (**the reported bug**) | the retail case and the primary-action case |
| the A4 pair is dropped for everyone | the hardware case |
| the receipt is demoted back to a text link | the primary-action case |

The third survived its first run against a weaker assertion (`tagName` is a
button, class contains `h-`) — true of almost any control. It now asserts the
receipt carries the same `h-14` the New sale button does and is **not** styled
with `underline`, which is what "primary, not a link" actually means.

### D186 — a reprint keeps the tender the first print recorded

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-11. **No schema change, no
migration** — the number was already on disk.

### What was reported

> "in we view the bill in sales its display balance as 0 still why is that"

D183—D185 fixed the receipt printed at the counter. Viewing the same bill from
Sales still showed `Balance 0.00`.

### The cause — and why the migration turned out to be unnecessary

D183 recorded a known limit: the tender is not stored, so a reprint cannot show
it, and persisting it needs columns on `Sale`.

**That was wrong, and the D183 record overstated the problem.** `Receipt.content`
is a JSON column, and `toReceiptContent` spreads the whole receipt payload into
it. The FIRST print therefore stored `amountTendered` already — incidentally,
not by design.

What went wrong is the other half: `upsertReceipt` **overwrites** `content` on
every print, and a reprint arrives with no tender of its own. So the first
reprint erased the stored number and then rendered without it. The data was
being deleted, not missing.

### The decision

**Carry the stored tender forward when the caller supplies none.**

```ts
const tender = amountTendered ?? (await this.storedTender(tenantId, saleId));
```

- **A supplied tender always wins.** The till is the authority for the sale it
  just took; a stale stored value must never override what was just counted.
- **It is written back**, so the second reprint still has it — otherwise the
  bug would return one print later.
- **The stored value is read defensively.** `content` is JSON written by this
  service, but it is still a column anything could have put a shape into, and a
  receipt that cannot be re-rendered is worse than one missing a row. Junk is
  ignored AND not written back, so a bad value cannot outlive whatever put it
  there.

### What this does and does not reach

| | |
|---|---|
| the receipt printed at the till | ✅ D183/D184 |
| **a reprint from Sales** | ✅ **this decision** |
| the sale DETAIL page (`/sales/:id`) | ❌ still reads `paidAmount` / `balanceAmount` |
| the A4 invoice | ❌ same |

Receipts printed **before** D183 have nothing stored and render exactly as they
always did, which is what the PO asked for: *"dont needed to fix old bill"*.

### Mutation proof

Three mutations, each failing the case that carries its decision:

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| the stored tender is not carried forward (**the reported bug**) | the render case and the write-back case |
| the stored value overrides a supplied one | "a supplied tender wins" |
| the defensive type check is dropped | "ignores a stored value that is not a usable number" |

The third survived its first run: `changeFor` already rejects junk when
rendering, so the check looked redundant. It is not — without it the junk is
**written back** into `content` and persists. The test now pins that, which is
what makes the branch killable.

### D185 — the receipt says four things, and none of them twice

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-11. Frontend/API display only. No
schema change, no migration.

### What was reported

D183/D184 worked, and the result was worse to read:

```
Total          Rs. 3,200.00
Paid           Rs. 3,200.00     <- the total again
Balance        Rs.     0.00     <- nothing
Cash received  Rs. 3,500.00
Change         Rs.   300.00
Status         PAID
Cash           Rs. 3,200.00     <- the total a third time
```

> "i think it display same data 3, like total, paid, cash — i want is display
> total, customer given amount, customer recive balance and status"

Correct. `Paid` equals the total on any settled sale, `Balance` is 0.00 by
definition when it is, and the trailing `Cash` row is the payment breakdown
repeating the total once more. The two figures the customer actually came for
were buried among five that told them nothing.

### The decision

**On an over-tendered cash sale, four rows:**

```
Total     Rs. 3,200.00
Cash      Rs. 3,500.00
Balance   Rs.   300.00
Status    PAID
```

`Cash` is what was handed over; `Balance` is what comes back. The PO chose
those words, and on this receipt they are unambiguous: nothing is owed, so
`Balance` can only mean the money going back across the counter.

### What is deliberately unchanged

Every other receipt keeps `Paid` / `Balance` and its full payment breakdown.
There `Balance` means money still **owed**, and the breakdown is the only
record of how a credit or split sale was settled. A card sale, a credit sale,
a restaurant bill and every reprint are byte-for-byte as before.

### The split-tender correction

The first version suppressed the payment rows whenever there was change, and
kept them only when there were several. Writing the test found the flaw: on a
**split** tender the change is not `tendered — total` at all — the cash covers
only its own share, so the subtraction is meaningless and would print a
negative.

The till never sends a tender for a split (it is sent only in single-method
CASH mode), so the short layout is now gated on **exactly one payment**, which
states what was already true instead of guarding a case the caller can reach.
A split keeps the full layout, and a test pins it.

### Mutation proof

Six mutations, each failing the case that carries its decision:

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| the short layout is never used (**the reported clutter, restored**) | the four-row case and the derivation case |
| the change guard is dropped | all three "prints neither" cases |
| `Cash` prints the total rather than the tender | the four-row case |
| the change is computed the wrong way round | three cases |
| a split tender takes the short layout | "KEEPS the full layout when split" |
| the duplicated payment row is printed again | the four-row case and the suppression case |

---

### D184 — the tender is captured when it is true, not when it is printed

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-11. Frontend only, one file. No
schema change, no migration.

### What was reported

D183 shipped and the receipt still printed no change. A Rs 3,776 sale paid with
Rs 4,000 printed `Paid 3,776 / Balance 0.00` — exactly as before the fix.

### Why D183 did not work

Not the server. Verified against the RUNNING API before touching anything: the
live build renders the rows correctly when the field arrives.

```
Total  2,750.00 | Paid  2,750.00 | Balance  0.00
Cash received  9,999.00 | Change  7,249.00 | PAID
```

The client never sent it. `payment/page.tsx` carries:

```ts
React.useEffect(() => {
  setTendered(total ? total.toFixed(2) : '');
}, [total]);
```

Completing a sale calls `cart.clearCart()`. That changes `total`, which fires
this effect, which **overwrites `tendered`** — and all of it happens before the
operator reaches the Thermal receipt button. D183 read `tendered` at print time
and always found the reset value, so its own guard correctly decided there was
no change to report.

### The decision

**Snapshot the tender at completion, beside the sale itself.**

`completedTender` is set in the same block as `setCompleted(sale)` and
deliberately BEFORE `clearCart()`. `printReceipt` reads the snapshot, never the
live field.

The guard moves with it: only a cash over-tender is kept, so every other shape
stores `null` and prints nothing, exactly as D183 intended.

### Why the tests did not catch it

D183's spec covers `renderCustomerReceipt` thoroughly — six cases, five
mutations, all killed — and every one of them still passes. They test the
TEMPLATE. Nothing tested the seam between the till and the template, and the
defect lived entirely in that seam: correct renderer, correct endpoint, correct
DTO, and a caller reading its own state one beat too late.

This is the shape D134's spec was written for and the shape `6.1b` shipped in:
every layer green, the chain broken at the join. The manual case that catches
it — **DOC-050** — was written with D183 and had not been run yet.

---

### D183 — the receipt says what crossed the counter, and what went back

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-10. **No schema change, no
migration.** Retail/hardware till only.

### What was reported

A sale of **Rs 2,478** paid with **Rs 5,000**. The payment screen showed
“Change Rs 2,522.00” twice. The printed bill showed:

> Total **2,478** · Paid **2,478** · Balance **0.00** · Status PAID · Cash **2,478**

The customer walked away with no record of the 5,000 they handed over or the
2,522 they got back.

### Where it was lost

`pos/payment/page.tsx`:

```ts
if (mode === 'CASH') {
  paidAmount = total;
  payments = [{ method: 'CASH', amount: total }];   // the tender dies here
}
```

`tendered` is local state, used for the on-screen change display and then
discarded. It never reached the API, so no document could print it. The
receipt was faithfully printing the only numbers it was given.

### What this decision does NOT do, and why

The obvious fix — “set Paid to 6,000 and Balance to the change” — breaks two
things, both silently:

1. **`balanceAmount` means money still OWED.** `credit.service` sums sales with
   `balanceAmount > 0` to build the debtors list. Writing the change there puts
   a walk-in customer on it, owing the shop's own money back.
2. **`Payment.amount` feeds cash reconciliation.** `dashboard.repository`
   groups payments by method and sums `amount`. Recording 5,000 would report
   Rs 2,522 more cash in the drawer than went into it.

The sale genuinely was **paid 2,478, owing 0**. The accounting was never wrong.
What was missing is that the tender and the change were **never recorded as
receipt facts**.

Two lighter routes were checked and are closed: `Sale` has no JSON column to
tuck them into, and `SalePaymentInputDto.amount` is `@IsPositive()`, so the
change cannot be stored as a negative payment row either.

### The decision

**`POST /receipts/:saleId/customer` takes an optional `amountTendered`, and the
template derives the change from it.**

```
Total            Rs. 2,478.00
Paid             Rs. 2,478.00
Balance          Rs.     0.00
Cash received    Rs. 5,000.00      <- new
Change           Rs. 2,522.00      <- new
Status           PAID
```

- **The change is DERIVED, not sent.** The caller passes only what it observed.
  A caller cannot make the paper print a change figure that does not follow
  from the two amounts printed beside it.
- **Nothing prints unless there is real change.** Exact money, an under-tender
  (that is a balance, and the rows above already say so) and a sub-cent
  rounding artefact all print nothing.
- **The body is optional.** A card sale, a credit sale, every restaurant bill
  and every REPRINT send nothing and render byte-for-byte as before.
- `paidAmount`, `balanceAmount` and `Payment.amount` are untouched.

### Deliberately out of scope: the reprint and the A4

The tender is **not stored**, so:

- a **reprint** from Sales history re-renders without it — `reprintCustomerReceipt`
  calls the same endpoint with no body, and cannot honestly claim a tender it
  never saw;
- `/sales/:id` and the **A4 invoice** likewise show only what is stored.

Persisting it needs two nullable columns on `Sale`, which is a shared table
that hardware and restaurant both write to. The PO declined that scope for now,
correctly: there was an **unresolved drift migration**
(`20260828081727`) making the API suite red at the time, and stacking a new
migration on top of it is how a schema gets into a state nobody can reason
about. Recorded here as the known limit rather than half-done.

**2026-09-14:** that drift folder is gone and the suite is green, so this
objection no longer stands. The scope decision does — persisting the tender is
still two nullable columns on a table hardware and restaurant share, and still
not done.

One thing this DOES reach: `toReceiptContent` spreads the receipt data into
`Receipt.content`, a JSON column, so the **original** receipt keeps a permanent
record of the tender even though a reprint re-renders without it.

### A redundant guard of my own, found by mutation

The first version had two guards: `tendered <= total` and `change <= 0`. The
second fully subsumes the first, so **no mutation could kill it** — which is
the definition of a branch doing no work. Removed rather than covered with a
test. Recorded because it is the D30 failure mode found in new code.

### Mutation proof

Five mutations, each failing the case that carries its decision:

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| the rows are never printed (**the reported bug, restored**) | the value case and the derivation case |
| the change guard is dropped | all three “prints neither” cases |
| “Cash received” prints the total rather than the tender | the value case |
| the change is computed the wrong way round | three cases |
| the sub-cent guard is dropped | exact-money and rounding-artefact |

`renderCustomerReceipt` had **no spec at all** before this, which is why every
row it prints was unasserted and this went unnoticed.

---

### D182 — merging `fix/restaurant-bill-preview`: how each clash was decided

One commit, forked from `9ccc4bb`: unattended printing comes back — a print
agent app, a Printing settings tab, a dispatcher, and the tables D68 dropped
restored beside the board rather than instead of it. Recorded there as D174.

**The migration was the first thing checked and the thing the PO asked
about.** One new folder, no existing migration modified, no schema change on
this side to collide with. Every statement in it ADDS — two enum values, one
enum, columns with defaults, two tables, indexes, foreign keys — and nothing
is dropped or rewritten, so a production database holding the earlier set
takes it without touching a row. Its timestamp sorts after this branch's
newest. Proven two ways rather than read: applied to the dev database on top
of the existing set (86 found, one applied, every existing row count
unchanged, the new tables empty), and the integration suite run from a fresh
database that replays all 86 from scratch.

**The migration folder was renamed, and that is only safe because it had never
run.** Their record was D174, which this log had already spent on lane counts
under a station cut; it becomes D181, and the folder went from `d174_` to
`d181_` with it. Prisma identifies an applied migration by its folder name, so
renaming one that has run anywhere would make every deployment that ran it
report it as missing — the exact break the PO's instruction forbids. This one
was applied nowhere: not on the dev database, not in production, whose set
ends where main's does. The SQL inside is byte-identical. Had it shipped, the
number in the folder name would have stayed wrong forever and the record
would have carried a note saying so.

**Four conflicts, all from this branch and theirs extending the same code in
the same week.** The kitchen DTO's imports: both sides added one, unioned. The
per-station spec's harness: D176 added a numbering stub and D181 a printer
chain, both needed since one round now resolves both, so both kept — and one
of their calls passed the printing options in the slot D176 had taken, fixed.
The route matrix: a shared 322 moved on both sides, set from the two deltas
to 338/233/105 and confirmed by the tripwire.

**The close was the one that needed thought.** Their bill-print enqueue sat at
the tail of the close and their kick after its commit, but D178 had since
split the close in two: `sendToCashier` raises the sale and holds the table,
and `settleBilledSession`, called from the PAYMENT, frees it. The enqueue now
sits in `sendToCashier` right after the sale is raised, inside the same
transaction, because the bill is wanted when it is SENT — the guest reads it
to decide how to pay — not when it is paid; and the kick follows that
transaction's commit.

One lint error in their spec: a regex matching raw ESC/POS bytes trips the
control-character rule. Suppressed at that line with the reason, since the
bytes are the assertion.

Verified rather than assumed, as in D158/D160/D173/D180: every file only they
changed is byte-identical to their branch, every file only this branch changed
is byte-identical to here, no decision heading appears twice, and both
tripwires — the exact migration set and the route inventory — pass.

Gates on the merged tree: typecheck 8/8, api unit 1584 across 96 suites, web
unit 1643 across 119 files (2 skipped), integration 1227 across 57 suites
from a fresh database, lint 0 errors (12 warnings, all pre-existing).
Playwright not run — it needs a live stack; the print agent has no test
runner of its own.

### D181 — the kitchen prints again, and the board is what makes that safe

**Status:** ACCEPTED, 2026-09-11, and being built. Supersedes exactly one clause
of D68. Recorded before implementation began, so that reversing a PO decision is
itself a decision rather than a drift someone notices six weeks later in a diff.

### What is being asked

When a cashier, a waiter or an owner sends an order to the kitchen, the
kitchen's own printer should produce the ticket, with nobody pressing anything.

One vocabulary correction is carried into the record because the request used
the other word: the kitchen receives a **KOT**, not a bill. The bill is the
customer's money document and prints at the till. This decision is about the
KOT; it leaves the bill where D68 put it.

### What D68 decided, and which part of it is actually being reversed

D68 has four parts. Only the first is touched:

| D68 clause | Under this record |
|---|---|
| Kitchen tickets are not printed at all | **reversed** |
| Kitchen staff are a role, holding three permissions | stands |
| A ticket carries where the food is going | stands — D152 strengthened it |
| The waiter completes the order; the cashier prints the bill | stands |

**D68's reasoning was not wrong and is not being called wrong.** It observed
that a row written inside the round's transaction cannot fail to arrive, while a
printer can, and concluded that the screen was the more reliable delivery. That
observation is still true and is the reason this record can be written safely at
all. What has changed is only the premise that the screen must therefore be the
*sole* delivery. A kitchen can read paper and a screen; it cannot cook what
never reached it.

### The condition that makes the reversal safe, and it is structural

**The board stays the authority. The paper is a copy, and the copy is allowed to
fail.**

- `KitchenTicket` is still written INSIDE the submit transaction, exactly as
  D152 leaves it. Ticket generation does not move, change shape, or acquire a
  printer dependency.
- The print QUEUE ROW is written inside the same transaction. A queue row is a
  database insert, exactly as reliable as the ticket beside it, and writing the
  two atomically is what stops a committed order from having no queued ticket.
  (An earlier draft of this record said the enqueue happens after the commit.
  That was wrong and is corrected here: it would open a window in which a crash
  loses the print silently, which is the failure this whole record exists to
  avoid.)
- **No network I/O to a printer ever happens inside a transaction.** The
  dispatcher drains the queue out of band, after the commit. A printer that is
  jammed, out of paper, unplugged or behind a dead switch cannot roll back a
  customer's order and cannot keep the ticket off the board; it leaves a FAILED
  attempt row and nothing else.
- A failed print surfaces against the order, not only in a log on a machine in
  the restaurant's back office.

This is the whole safety argument, so it gets a test rather than a promise: a
spec asserts that a printer which fails every attempt still leaves the ticket
QUEUED and legible on the board. Without that assertion, a later change that
moves the enqueue inside the transaction would undo this decision in fact while
the record still reads as accepted.

### Why an on-site agent is forced rather than preferred

`apps/api` runs on EC2 and the kitchen printer answers on a private address
inside the restaurant. There is no route between them, and a browser cannot
speak raw ESC/POS at all — which is why D153's Print button, useful as it is,
prints on whatever machine the board happens to be open on rather than in the
kitchen. A program running inside the restaurant, dialling outward, is the only
arrangement that reaches the printer without exposing port 9100 to the internet
or requiring a static address at every site.

The one alternative that avoids an agent — printers that poll the cloud
themselves, such as Epson's Server Direct Print — is rejected because it makes
every future hardware purchase at every site a compatibility question.

### What comes back, and from where

Restored from `63ee8e9^` rather than reinvented, on D152's precedent. The D67
work was deleted, not disproved; it already knows about tenants, branches,
permissions and this schema, which is the expensive part of such a system and
the part a generic reference implementation does not have.

Returning: the `printing` module (ESC/POS encoder, drivers, dispatcher, worker,
the agent controller/guard/service, the KOT and bill templates), the
`apps/print-agent` application, and the Settings → Printing screen.

D68's migration `20260903000000_kitchen_ticket_completion` is the precise
inventory of what an additive migration must put back: the `PrintAgent` and
`UserPrinterPreference` tables, the `PrinterRole` type, the lease columns on
`KitchenPrintAttempt` and `PrintJob`, `PrintJob.branchId`/`orderId`/`printerId`,
`KitchenPrinter.columns`/`role`, the `ORDER_BILL` value on `PrintJobType`, and
`RestaurantBranchConfig.autoPrintKot` / `autoPrintBill` / `billCopies` /
`defaultKitchenPrinterId` / `defaultReceiptPrinterId`.

That last group matters: the per-branch switch this request needs was already
designed and is simply absent. Restoring it is additive under D15, and nothing
in it is destructive — D68's migration deleted `ORDER_BILL` rows on the way out,
so there is no data to reconcile.

### Three things this design keeps that the supplied reference implementation does not

A reference implementation was supplied alongside the request (a Socket.IO
gateway plus a Node agent). Its architecture is correct and agrees with D67's on
every point that matters. Three differences are decided here rather than left to
whoever writes the code:

1. **The server renders; the agent only pushes bytes.** The reference renders
   the KOT and the bill on the agent. Because the agent is installed per site,
   that makes every layout change a visit to every restaurant — and this bill's
   layout has already moved three times by decision (D72, D99, D102). D67's
   README already stated the rule and it is adopted: *"it never renders
   documents, so changing a receipt layout needs no agent update."*
2. **Printer configuration lives in `KitchenPrinter`, not in a file on the shop
   PC.** The table and its admin CRUD already exist. A JSON file on a till is a
   second source of truth that no one in the office can see, and changing a
   kitchen printer's IP becomes a site visit.
3. **An agent is a database row, not an environment variable.** The reference
   registers devices through `PRINT_AGENT_DEVICES_JSON`, making every new
   restaurant an API redeploy. D67's `PrintAgent` row with a hashed token and a
   pair-once screen is restored instead.

### Routing is D152's, and is not rebuilt

The reference carries its own `kitchen-routing.service`. It is not adopted.
D152's routing already decides the station, already falls back to `MAIN`, and is
structurally incapable of dropping an unlinked dish — a property bought with an
adversarial review and a superseded decision, which a second router would not
inherit.

### Idempotency is the ticket id

A KOT job is keyed on `KitchenTicket.id` and on nothing else. The reference keys
on order, printer and station, which collides on the **second round at the same
table**: the key is identical, the job is discarded as a duplicate, and the
kitchen is never told it missed anything. Rounds are how this product composes an
order, so that is not an edge case here. `KitchenTicket.primaryPrinterId` —
present since D152 and written by nothing — becomes the recorded destination.

### The bill does not change by default

The browser path stays the default for the till's own printer: a human presses
the button, the destination is that machine's printer, the dialog is expected,
and it works today. The agent path is offered per branch and is worth taking for
exactly one reason — **a browser cannot kick a cash drawer.** A branch that
wants the drawer takes the agent path; a branch that does not, changes nothing.
An ESC/POS bill template reproducing what `thermal-bill.ts` renders is the one
piece of genuinely new work in this record.

### What was rejected

**Socket.IO now.** D67's outbound HTTPS poll with a lease TTL needs no sticky
sessions and no Redis adapter, and O2 is still open. A kitchen tolerates a
second or two. The socket is a later optimisation, not a starting requirement.

**A second print-jobs table.** `PrintJob` already carries the lifecycle and the
retry behaviour, for the reasons D127 gave when it widened the table rather than
splitting it.

**Printing without the board.** Not proposed by anyone, recorded so that nobody
reads this as a return to D67. D67's failure was never the machinery; it was
that paper was the only delivery.

### Open question this raises

No ESC/POS code page encodes Sinhala or Tamil, so a menu carrying non-Latin item
names needs bitmap rendering rather than a configuration change. Raised as O13
because it decides a rendering pipeline, and is cheaper to answer before the
templates are written than after.

### As built — where the code departed from the draft above, and why

Written after implementation, 2026-09-11, so the record describes what runs.

**The queue rows are written inside the round transaction** (corrected above).
`KitchenService.generateTicketsForRound` resolves the station's printers and
writes one PENDING `KitchenPrintAttempt` per device beside the ticket;
`PrintingService.enqueueBillForSale` writes the bill job inside the close.
Callers `kick()` the dispatcher after commit. No socket is opened inside a
transaction anywhere.

**Print state never writes the ticket.** D67's dispatcher and agent-ack path
set `KitchenTicket.status` to PRINTED / FAILED; both writes are gone. A reprint
is detected from the attempt history (a prior SUCCEEDED row), not from the
status. `auto-printing.spec.ts` asserts on every path — direct success, three
failures, agent ack — that the ticket is still QUEUED and still on the
outstanding board, and that a cook's IN_PROGRESS survives a reprint.

**`UserPrinterPreference` was not restored**, and D67's per-user routing layer
went with it (`resolveCashierPrinterId`, `resolveKitchenPrinterIdForUser`,
`GET|PUT /printing/my-printers`). The chain is now station links (primary
first) → the branch's `defaultKitchenPrinterId`; the bill goes to
`defaultReceiptPrinterId` and nowhere else. Only ACTIVE printers of the tenant
are returned, so a link to a retired device yields no attempt rather than
three failed ones — and a station whose only link is retired does NOT fall
through to the branch default, because a link naming a dead device is a
configuration to fix, not to paper over.

**The test page rides the queue.** `PrintJobType` gained `PRINTER_TEST`
alongside the restored `ORDER_BILL`. On a branch with a live agent the
operator's Test print creates a job (`queued: true`, `jobId`) that the agent
leases like any other and the screen polls through `GET /printing/jobs/:id`;
with no agent the server prints it synchronously, which on an on-prem install
is the shop LAN. The draft's synchronous-only test was useless for the
deployment that actually exists.

**The agent's persistent local queue was NOT adopted**, contrary to the
"fold in" list above. The POS itself is in the cloud: when the uplink is down
no order can be placed, so there is nothing new to spool; and a crash between
print and ack is already covered by the server's 60 s lease TTL. Local state
would only add a second place for a row to be. D67's "the agent holds no state
worth backing up" stands.

**The 2-second `servedByAgent` cache is gone.** A just-paired agent could watch
the server print its first ticket, and a just-revoked one could strand a row;
the drain now asks once per pass (`liveAgentBranches`, one query), and callers
outside a drain ask fresh.

**The takeaway bill prints at SETTLE, not at placement.** D67 printed a
pre-settlement bill against the order because the counter did not settle
until handover; D117 moved settlement to payment time, so the settled Sale is
the source — same document, same calculator, paid amount included — and a
handover after settle prints nothing twice. `enqueueOrderBill` remains for a
branch that later wants the placement-time document, unused.

**Printing is a Settings TAB** (`PrintingTab`, restaurant-only, self-saving),
not D67's `/settings/printing` route with its own nav entry: every per-branch
setting has lived on the Settings tabs since D84, and the switches read the
same versioned config row Charges does.

**The agent's Windows USB transport is the reference implementation's winspool
helper**, resolved from `__dirname` rather than the working directory (a
service manager starts the agent from wherever it likes). Address = the
printer's Windows name. Installed as a service, not a startup shortcut.

**Route matrix**: 12 ENFORCED routes under KITCHEN and 3 `public-no-tenant`
agent routes; 337 total.

**The test print says when the device is not a receipt printer.** Found on
the first live try: the kitchen printer was pointed at a Canon inkjet, which
accepts raw bytes on port 9100 like any office printer, and the screen read
"Test page printed" while nothing came out — "delivered" was true and useless.
After a delivered network test the server now sends DLE EOT 1 (ESC/POS
real-time status); a receipt printer answers with a byte, an office printer
stays silent, and silence becomes a WARNING beside the success ("check that
192.168.0.75 is the thermal printer; if a page came out, ignore this") rather
than a failure, because some genuine printers ship with status replies off.
Server path only — the agent's ack carries no channel for it yet.

**An office printer can print the ticket as plain text (kind `A4_NETWORK`).**
The same first live try had one thermal printer, in use at a till, and one
Canon inkjet on the LAN for testing. Rather than leave "no ESC/POS device, no
test", the builder gained a plain-text mode: the SAME templates, no control
sequences, centring by spaces, a form feed for the cut, ASCII-only
transliteration. `renderOptions(printer)` picks it by kind, so neither the
templates nor the agent decide anything; the agent hands the bytes to the
Windows spooler with data type TEXT instead of RAW, and the printer's own
driver lays them out. Address = the printer's Windows name on the agent PC.
The server's direct path refuses the kind with a message that says to run the
agent, since only the agent has a spooler. The test print's DLE EOT probe does
not apply to this kind. Verified live: a round placed through the API came out
of the Canon as a text page within one poll, Windows job "Complete, 1 page".

**The thermal KOT follows the mainstream kitchen-ticket layout** (owner,
2026-09-11: "industry standard"), replacing D67's: order type (DINE IN /
TAKEAWAY / DELIVERY) and the table — or the order number, with the customer's
name — as the only double-size text; ticket number and stamp; order, round,
server and station on their own lines; quantity first and the item in double
HEIGHT (D67's double width halved the columns without telling the wrapper, so
long names broke mid-word at the printer's 24th column); variant in capitals,
modifiers with `+`, instructions with `>>` in bold capitals; a blank line
between items; an item count at the foot; reprint marker; feed and cut. Found
on the way: the builder's word-wrap had eaten leading spaces since D67, so
nothing under a dish had ever printed indented — fixed, with the indent kept on
every wrapped line. The on-screen KOT (D153's Print button) is unchanged and
now differs from the paper one; aligning it touches a PO-supplied format and is
left for the PO. Live on the Xprinter XP-Q80B: two-station order, two tickets,
both via the agent.

### D180 — merging `fix/waiter-status-change`: how each clash was decided

One commit, forked from `fix/restaurant-owner-v2` at `985f3b6` before that
branch's own last two commits: the waiter sends the bill and the till settles
it, with the table freeing when paid; the arrangement's server line names
people rather than tabs; the queue card shows each round's kitchen state; and
a Completed tab so All Orders is the live queue. Recorded there as D151b, D153,
D153a and D154.

**No migration on either side**, checked first because the PO asked for it:
their commit touches neither the schema nor the migrations directory, so
production's set is not in play.

**Numbering: a fork of a fork.** The branch inherits the restaurant branch's
D150–D152b, already D155–D157b here, and its own four collided with this
log's D153 (the printed KOT) and D154 (the board's polling cost). Two branches
off the same parent had both taken D153 for different subjects. Mapped so the
inherited records land on identical text and the four new ones take the next
free numbers: D151b → D156b (a correction to their D151, which is D156 here),
D153 → D178, D153a → D178a, D154 → D179. The first attempt left D152a/b out of
the map and the sweep's unmapped-token report caught it.

**Seven conflicts. Four were the fork predating a later decision.** The floor,
the session panel and the my-tables spec all conflicted on D157c's "a
supervisor works the whole room", which the restaurant branch added after this
one forked; HEAD kept in each case. The floor's server-line COMMENT conflicted
while the code beneath it had auto-merged from their side, so theirs was taken
— it describes the de-duplication that is actually there. Two were additive:
`rounds` on the queue's view type and on its service, theirs taken whole.

**The route matrix hid a third total again.** HEAD had 322 and theirs 319 from
a shared 318; git conflicted on the two sub-totals but would have accepted
either headline. Set to 323/221/102 from the two deltas and confirmed by the
tripwire.

**The decision log needed rebuilding, not resolving.** Git had aligned two
unrelated blocks of appended prose and produced eleven interleaved regions;
resolving them line by line would have spliced a retail record into a
restaurant one. The file was rebuilt record by record instead: HEAD's log, plus
the four records their side has and HEAD lacks, plus their one edit to a
shared record — a supersede note on D117 pointing at D154, re-pointed at D179.
Verified by asserting no heading appears twice.

**One thing brought into line after the merge.** Their queue card labels each
round "Round n"; D177 retired that word three days after they forked. It now
goes through `sendLabel` like every other surface, and their spec follows.

Verified rather than assumed, as in D158/D160/D173: every file only they
changed is byte-identical to their branch, every file only this branch changed
is byte-identical to here. D151's removals hold. Their one new route reached
the route-module tripwire.

Left undone: their four decisions ship no `testcases.md` rows.

Gates on the merged tree: typecheck 7/7, api unit 1549 across 95 suites, web
unit 1643 across 119 files (2 skipped), integration 1209 across 56 suites, lint
0 errors (13 warnings, all pre-existing). Playwright not run — it needs a live
stack.

### D179 — a Completed tab, and All Orders is the live queue

**Asked by the PO, 2026-09-11**: *"add a section in the order section add a
completed tab then move all the completed orders to it."*

**Supersedes D117 on its tab strip.** D117's *"no need completed tab hide it"*
was said of a counter whose orders never reached COMPLETED — the dine-in
shell had no writer for it, so a Completed tab would have been a tab for
nothing. D178 gave it a writer: a paid table is COMPLETED. The PO now wants
them somewhere, and out of the way.

**Now.**
- The strip reads **All Orders · Pending · Preparing · Ready · To pay ·
  Completed · Cancelled**. The **Handed over** tab is gone; a handed-over
  takeaway is a finished order and lives under Completed beside a paid table,
  which is also how the metric strip has always counted them.
- **All Orders is the live queue.** It asks the server for a new bucket,
  `status=OUTSTANDING` — everything that is not COMPLETED or HANDED_OVER.
  Cancelled stays in it, as today. The Completed tab asks for `status=DONE`.
- Tab counts: All is the whole branch **minus** the finished rows; Completed
  is exactly those rows; the two still add up to everything.

**A bare list still returns everything — deliberately.** `OUTSTANDING` and
`DONE` are two more values the query accepts beside the unified statuses and
`ALL`; an omitted status, and `ALL`, mean what they meant. Three reasons, in
order of weight: every spec that reads a row back through an unfiltered
`listOrders` (the payment-status cases read a HANDED_OVER takeaway that way,
the kitchen-board cases read a round's status that way) keeps passing without
being edited (D16); `?status=COMPLETED` and `?status=HANDED_OVER` from an old
bookmark still mean that one status; and the page's default tab keeps a clean
URL — it maps ALL to `OUTSTANDING` at the request, so a first load looks as it
always did.

**Deliberately not done:** hiding Cancelled from All (it has its own tab and
the PO did not ask); a date cut-off on Completed (the existing date filter
does that already).

**Paired per D30** (`orders-page.completed-tab.render.test.tsx`,
`round-preview.spec.ts`): Completed present and Handed over absent; the
default load sends OUTSTANDING and writes nothing to the URL; tapping
Completed writes and sends DONE; a plain status still sends itself; the
counts. Server side: OUTSTANDING is exactly the unfinished rows, DONE exactly
the finished ones, and no status / ALL is still the whole set. Mutation-proven
on the ALL→OUTSTANDING mapping and on the All count (1 failed / 4 passed
each).

**Migration: none.** Nothing new is stored; `OrderRoundStatus` was already on
the wire, and the buckets are query values.

Found by review, pre-existing, no tenant is in such a zone today. Fix the helper, or leave it? | before a tenant in Cuba/Chile |
### D178a — the queue card shows each round's kitchen state

**Asked by the PO, 2026-09-11**: *"im order fried rice then after go to the
kitchen … in the second time im order a milkshake … the kitchen the fried rice
mark as done in the waiter order page shows its now preparing … the card show
pls the fried rice ready not the milkshake ready. now the all are completed
then show its proceed to pay."*

**What was there.** The card carried the order's unified status and a flat
item preview. The status is derived correctly — an order is READY only when
*every* round is (D113), and that is what gates **Proceed to pay** (D178) —
but a two-round table with the rice up and the shake still on the pass read a
bare **Preparing**, with nothing saying which was which.

**Now.** The row carries `rounds[]` — number, `OrderRoundStatus`, and the
items the kitchen received on it — and the card lists **one line per round**
with its own badge (`Sent` / `Preparing` / `Ready` / `Served`, the same map the
rounds sheet uses). The order-level badge and the button are unchanged: the
badge flips to Ready and the button appears when the last round is bumped,
exactly as before. A third-party row has no rounds of ours and keeps its item
preview.

**Also fixed here.** The controller's status allow-list never learned
`AWAITING_PAYMENT`, so the To pay tab's filter fell back to ALL on the server
and the tab showed every order. Caught by the live walkthrough for this
record; pinned in the D178 spec.

**Paired per D30** (`orders-page.rounds.render.test.tsx`,
`round-preview.spec.ts`): the half-ready row shows Round 1 · Ready and Round
2 · Preparing with no button; the all-ready row shows both Ready with the
button; items group onto their round and rounds sort by number; a stub with
no round ids previews nothing rather than a phantom round. Mutation-proven
on the per-line status (every line restating round 1's — 1 failed / 3
passed); honest that keying the list on the item preview instead of the
rounds is unprovable, since on every real row the two are empty together.

### D178 — the waiter sends the bill, the till settles it, and the table frees when it is paid

**Asked by the PO, 2026-09-11**: *"after ready then the waiter after give to the
customer then give a button … proceed to pay … the cashier can print the bill
without payment then after waiter give the printed bill to customer then after
with the cash the waiter go with cash and give to the cashier and after paid
bill printed and order status marked completed … then the table also
unreserved. That is the flow."*

**What was there.** One forward move, and it did too much at once. "Close &
send one bill" raised the Sale and, in the same transaction, set the table back
to AVAILABLE — before a rupee had moved. The floor showed a free table with
guests still at it waiting for their bill; the till had no queue telling it a
bill was waiting; nothing recorded that the food had been served; and the
order shell never left SUBMITTED, so "Completed" was a status nobody could
reach. D68 wrote the sentence — *the waiter completes the order; the cashier
prints the bill* — and the code released the table one step early.

**Now — the flow, in the order it happens on the floor.**

1. **The kitchen bumps** the ticket. Unchanged (D113): the round is READY, the
   floor shows *Food ready*, the queue shows the order under **Ready**.
2. **The waiter presses "Proceed to pay."** On the Ready card's footer, in the
   order drawer, and on the POS table strip (where "Close & send one bill" used
   to be) — three doors onto one verb,
   `POST /restaurant/table-sessions/:id/send-to-cashier`, `TABLE_CLOSE`. It
   raises the Sale exactly as the close always did — the money maths did not
   move a line — and then:
   - every READY round goes **DELIVERED** (the waiter pressing this has, by
     definition, put the food down; a round the kitchen still holds is left to
     the kitchen, and lands READY when bumped exactly as on an open table);
   - the session goes **BILLING**, `finalSaleId` set, `closedAt` **null**;
   - the physical table goes **BILLING** — *Bill requested* on the floor, a
     label and a dashboard tile that were written under D49 and had never once
     been true;
   - **nothing is released.**
3. **The till sees it under "To pay"** — a new bucket between Ready and Handed
   over, from a new unified status `AWAITING_PAYMENT` derived from the SESSION
   being BILLING (serving does not move the bucket; asking for the bill does).
   The card carries **Print bill** and **Collect payment** for a role holding
   `PAYMENT_COLLECT`; the waiter sees the same row with no buttons.
4. **The cashier prints the bill unpaid.** D87 stands: only the till prints.
   The waiter carries paper the cashier printed — a floor process, not a
   permission change. `Paid Amount : 0.00`, balance = total.
5. **The cashier records the cash.** The existing `collectPayment`, unchanged in
   what it writes to the Sale. A PARTIAL payment settles nothing.
6. **The payment that clears the balance ends it**, inside the same
   transaction and after the `billingVersion` check: every order on the
   session → **COMPLETED** with an append-only history row (`reason: 'Bill
   paid'`, the cashier's id); the session → **CLOSED** with `closedAt`; and
   the table is released through the SAME `releaseResources` the close used
   to call — physical → AVAILABLE, arrangement last-one-out (D104). The paid
   bill prints itself from the queue card: the guest is leaving and that is
   the paper they leave with.

**A table at the till is still a table with guests at it.** `LIVE_SESSION_STATUSES`
already said so (D104); `listOpenSessions` did not, and filtered on OPEN alone,
so the first thing "Proceed to pay" did was make the table vanish from the
floor. It now lists OPEN and BILLING. `openSession` refuses to reseat it and
`createOrder` refuses to add to it — the order is locked by the session not
being OPEN, which is the lock the PO asked about and the one that costs nothing.

**`Sale.status` is untouched.** D52 parked "a bill that exists before payment"
as a financial-state redesign, and this record does not reopen it. The Sale is
still written COMPLETED / UNPAID at the moment it is raised; every report, the
returns path and the sync see exactly what they saw. What moved is *when the
table frees*, which is a floor state, not a financial one.

**The hook is inert where it must be**, by one check — the sale's session must
be BILLING: a bill raised before this record (session already CLOSED, table
long free — proven with the next party already seated at it), a counter or
takeaway sale (no session, or one `takeaway.settle` closed itself), a partial
payment, and a split bill whose siblings are outstanding (one Sale, PAID once).

**A bill for nothing is paid already.** A party that walks out before ordering
leaves a 0.00 Sale (as the close always did), and no payment can ever land on
it — `collectPayment` refuses an amount of zero — so a table held "until paid"
would be held forever. `sendToCashier` settles a zero-total bill on the spot,
through the same `settleBilledSession` the paying cashier goes through: CLOSED,
COMPLETED, released. Found on the running stack, not on paper; pinned in the
D178 spec. (The Sale stays UNPAID with a zero balance, exactly as the old close
left it — a pre-existing oddity D52 owns, not this record.)

**Idempotent.** A second "Proceed to pay" on a table already at the till
answers with the same Sale, 200, and raises no second one. `finalSaleId
@unique` stays the structural guard underneath. The old `/close` route stays
mounted and does the same thing.

**The queue row carries `sessionId` now.** It was E18 (D155): the view had a
sale id for the bill but never the session id for the table, so the drawer's
*Open in POS* sat disabled behind a stub returning `''`. The card's button
needed the id anyway; the stub is gone and *Open in POS* works.

**The card is a `<div>`.** It was one `<button>` wrapping everything, which
cannot hold a second button (nested interactive content is invalid HTML and
Chrome un-nests it silently). The order number is a stretched button — the
whole card still opens the drawer — and the footer's actions sit above it.

**Existing assertions this supersedes (D16 — named, not quietly edited):**
- `apps/api/test/integration/specs/table-sessions.spec.ts` — the close returned
  `session.status: 'CLOSED'`; now `'BILLING'`. The mutation proof was "a
  second close is refused (409)"; it is now "a second close answers with the
  same sale and exactly one Sale row exists", which is the same claim stated
  about the thing that matters.
- `apps/api/test/integration/specs/open-table-multi-tab.spec.ts` (D104/D105/D106)
  — every "close" is now settle (send, then pay in full), and the
  `openTableRelease` summary the `/close` response carried is read back from
  the tables and the arrangement's live tabs. Which members come back, and
  when, is asserted exactly as before. One case is added: sending alone frees
  nothing.
- `apps/web/src/components/pos/dine-in/table-bill-sheet.render.test.tsx` — the
  verb is `sendToCashier`, the button *Proceed to pay*, the unsent-items
  question *"Send the bill anyway?"*, and the split-failure warning says the
  bill is *at the till* rather than that the table is *closed* — because it is
  not.

**Paired per D30.** `table-sessions-proceed-to-pay-d153.spec.ts`: the send is
asserted to have raised the bill (positive) AND to have moved nothing on the
floor (negative); the partial payment to have landed AND freed nothing; the
recall of a served ticket to move the ticket AND not the round; the waiter to
send and be refused on collect, the till the reverse. `unified-status.spec.ts`:
BILLING → To pay whatever the rounds say, and the same rounds under OPEN /
CLOSED / no session derive as before. `orders-page.proceed-to-pay.render.test.tsx`:
which rows carry which verb, for which role; mutation-proven on the DINE_IN
guard and the tab (1 failed / 9 passed each), and honest that the overlay's
stacking cannot be proven in jsdom.

**Deliberately not done.**
- A separate "Mark served" tap. The PO's own description has none; "Proceed to
  pay" records it. The per-round verb remains available to a later record.
- A "needs cleaning" state on release. `CLEANING` exists in the enum, unwritten
  since D49; this record does not start writing it.
- A waiter-side Print. D87.
- Server-side `PrintJob` rows for restaurant bills. Printing stays
  browser-side, as D68/D69 left it.
- Carrying `openTableRelease` on the payment response. D155 dropped the D50
  release reminder it fed; nothing reads it.

**Migration: none.** Every value this record starts writing already exists —
`TableSessionStatus.BILLING` and `RestaurantTableStatus.BILLING` (D49),
`OrderRoundStatus.DELIVERED` and `RestaurantOrderItemStatus.DELIVERED` (Phase
5), `RestaurantOrderStatus.COMPLETED` (Phase 5). `UnifiedOrderStatus` is a
TypeScript union on both sides of the wire, not a database enum. One route is
added and classified in `route-module-matrix.spec.ts` (319 routes, 219 guarded).

### D156b — the arrangement's server line names people, not tabs

**Asked by the PO, 2026-09-11**: *"in the waiter section in the tables tab
shows the surandi: Restaurant Waiter like one i think its not the best."*

**What was there.** D156a put a name on every table. On a joined table it
rendered one entry per tab as `<tab>: <waiter>`, so an arrangement with a tab
called "surandi" read **surandi: Restaurant Waiter** — directly under a button
that already says **View surandi**. The tab name was on the card twice, and a
waiter running two tabs was named twice.

**Now.** The line is the **distinct waiter names**, joined ` · `, nothing
else. The tab name lives on its View button, which is where somebody looking
for a tab is already looking. A physical table's line (D156a) is unchanged.

**Paired per D30** (`table-floor.server-line.render.test.tsx`): one waiter on
two tabs is named once and the `tab:` form is asserted absent; two waiters
are both named; the physical card is the control.

### D177 — a round is a "send" on screen, and a card is wide enough for its number

PO, 2026-09-11, two things in one breath.

**"Round" was the wrong word, and the PO asked for a better one.** It is the
data model's word and it stays there. On a ticket it read as bar service —
one order of drinks for a table — and on a food ticket it told a cook nothing
about what the thing was. Three options were put to the PO: drop the word
from the screens entirely (the ticket number already says it), "send", or
"course". They chose "send". Course would have been wrong whenever a second
send is more mains, which in table service it usually is; dropping it loses a
distinction a kitchen reading two tickets for one table an hour apart does
use.

So a round is now "1st send", "2nd send", "3rd send" wherever a person reads
it: the board ribbon, the ticket dialog, the history table, the bill sheet,
the session sheet and the printed KOT. ONE function spells it — `sendLabel`
in the restaurant labels — so the word cannot drift into "Round" on one
surface and "send" on another. Its one trap is pinned: 11th, 12th and 13th,
not 11st, 12nd, 13rd.

**"The KOT number is not fully visible."** The cause was not the grid width
alone, and widening the grid alone would have masked it. The card's footer row
carries the ticket number plus the Print and Details buttons D153 added, and
the number was the element marked `truncate` — correct for a long
completed-by name on a Done card, which must not drag the buttons out of the
row, and wrong for the one string on the card the pass calls out. Three
changes, each pinned: the number no longer shrinks or wraps; the two button
LABELS are what give instead, hidden below `lg` while every button keeps its
full accessible name; and the grid stops at three columns rather than four,
because a card that cannot show its own number is not a card the pass can
call out.

### D176 — a kitchen ticket numbers from its own counter

PO, 2026-09-11, on being told what an RO- number was: "I'd rather the two ran
independently."

**They shared a stream.** An order number and a ticket number were both drawn
from the `RESTAURANT_ORDER` sequence, so they interleaved: 13 orders and 17
tickets had reached RO-000029 and KOT-000030, neither series contiguous, and
adjacent digits across the two meant nothing. A ticket number is a thing the
pass calls out in sequence, and "31, 32, 33" only reads as one when nothing
else consumed 32. Tickets now draw from `KITCHEN_TICKET`. No migration:
`DocumentSequence.docType` is a plain string.

**The migration path is the whole difficulty.** `KitchenTicket` has a
per-tenant unique on the number, and every tenant that has cooked before holds
KOT-000001 onward from the old stream. A fresh counter starting at 1 would mint
KOT-000001 again on its first use, hit the unique, and roll back the
round-submit transaction — the guests' food would not reach the kitchen
because of a numbering change. So the first allocation on a tenant reads the
highest ticket number it already holds and seeds the counter AT it, inside the
round's own transaction so two rounds racing to be first cannot both seed. A
tenant that has never cut a ticket seeds nothing and starts at one. After that
first allocation the counter is the authority and the tickets table is never
consulted again: a seed is a one-time migration, not a reconciliation, and a
counter that could move backwards would not be a counter.

Pinned four ways by mutation and once against a real database: the shared
stream restored, the seed dropped, the seed set one above the floor, and the
seed re-run on every round each turn a unit test red; and an integration test
wipes the counter, plants KOT-000500 from the old stream, sends a round, and
asserts KOT-000501 with no unique violation.

**Orders are untouched.** They keep `RESTAURANT_ORDER`, so a live tenant's next
order continues its existing series with no gap and no renumbering. Tickets
already minted keep the digits they have.

### D175 — the history filters by station and table, and stops searching them

PO, 2026-09-11: "instead of having station and table in search, add a filter
button that will expand to show multi-filter options for both of them."

**Two search legs become two structured filters.** The history's free-text
search had five OR legs: ticket number, order number, table/tab/area, station
name and dish. The station and table legs are gone from it, and the box says
what remains — ticket, order, dish. In their place a Filters button beside the
search opens a panel with a Station group and a Table group, each a row of
multi-select chips, a badge counting active filters, and a Clear action.
Changing a filter resets to page one exactly as the search does.

On the wire they are repeatable query params, each an array of ids; a ticket
matches when its station is IN the set AND its table is IN the set, and an
empty set applies no filter on that axis. Two details of that shape matter.
An empty set adds no clause at all rather than `in: []`, which is a legal
clause that matches nothing. And a single value arrives from Express as a
string, not a one-element array, so the DTO wraps it before validating —
asserted through a real ValidationPipe with the real options, because a DTO
that typed the field as an array and received a string is the classic NestJS
trap and it would have 400'd every one-station filter.

**A takeaway matches only when no table is chosen.** It has no table a person
would pick, but on the wire it hangs off a synthetic "Walk In" area the server
creates lazily at position 999 (delivery at 998), because every session needs
a table row. The area list returns those like any other, and left in they put
a "Walk In" chip in the panel whose selection would ADMIT takeaway tickets —
the opposite of what "filter by table" means. The panel hides areas at or above
position 998; the floor plan does not, because it wants to show them. Found by
a verifier, not by the author.

The Station column and the em dash for a stationless ticket are exactly as
D152 left them.

### D174 — every lane chip carries its number under a station cut too

PO, 2026-09-11: "the Done tab is only showing the counter next to it while in
the All stations sub tab."

**This was a choice, and it was the wrong one.** D152 restored the station
filter and, on the lane the board is not fetching, withheld the chip's number
whenever a station was selected — the count came from the server and the
server counted the branch, so "Done 7" over a lane that would show two cards
was judged worse than no number. The PO has ruled that D142b's rule stands
without exception: every chip carries its number, whichever lane is open, and
under a cut it is the STATION's number.

**Solved at the source, not by withholding.** The list read and the standalone
counts route both take an optional `stationId`. It is one more clause on the
SAME shared count queries, not a second definition, so the two exposures stay
pinned to each other: an integration test asserts the envelope's counts equal
the counts route's for the same station, across every lane. Omitted, both
routes emit byte-for-byte what they did. A stationless ticket from the D147
window belongs to no station, so it is in the "All stations" numbers and in
no station's — equality never matches null.

**The board keeps its list UNSCOPED, and that is the interesting decision.** The
contract as first written had the board pass the station on the list read. A
verifier showed why it cannot: the station strip under the lanes counts EVERY
station's share of the current lane — D152's "where is the work?" — and from a
list the server had already cut to one station every other chip would read
zero, the exact failure D152's own comment forbids. So the board reads the
whole lane, cuts it client-side for the cards and the active chips, and under
a cut asks the counts route for the one lane it is not showing. An unfiltered
board is still one request per tick (D154); a cut is two. The alternatives —
reading the cut list a second time, or per-station counts in every envelope —
cost more for the same three integers.

What that costs: under a cut the off-lane chip is a second snapshot, so a bump
landing between the two concurrent reads can leave a card on To make while
Done counts it, for one tick. Narrowed to milliseconds and self-healing; the
PO prefers a number to a blank.

**REPEATABLE READ is now asserted, on both reads.** D154 pinned the list read
at that level and said so; D174 gives the counts route the same, since it now
feeds a chip. A verifier dropped the option from both and every test stayed
green — the stub's one-argument signature had made the isolation level
invisible to the spec for a decision and a half. Both are pinned now, and both
mutants die.

### D173 — merging `feature/retail-template-v2`: how each clash was decided

Seventeen commits from the same `c3c316f` fork the restaurant branch came from:
a tenant defines its own business details (withdrawing D135's attribute packs),
the Inventory tab bar becomes per-workspace, retail's bill moves to a roll while
its quotations stay on the letterhead, the document previews learn whose trade
they are showing, the product Overview says what a product IS, SKU generation
and opening stock are fixed, and buy-X-get-Y offers stop being able to leave a
sale half-satisfied. Recorded there as D150–D161.

**Every one of their twelve numbers was taken**, which is the worst of the three
collisions so far: this branch holds D150–D154 of its own, D155–D157c and
D159/a/b merged from `fix/restaurant-owner-v2`, and D158/D160 as merge records.
The whole block shifts by eleven, D150 → D161 … D161 → D172, in one pass —
sequential replacement would have mapped D150 → D161 and then that same D161 →
D172.

That branch had already renumbered itself once (its D138–D142 became D150–D154,
per its own tip commit), so before starting I checked whether the sweep had left
anything behind. It had not: the only D138–D142 citations in its code are the
restaurant decisions inherited from the fork.

**Their twelve records also arrived as `## ` headings** where the other 154 use
`### `. In this file `## ` is a document section — "## Open decisions" is one —
so as written they sat structurally alongside the dividers of the log rather
than inside it. Normalised as part of the renumber. Twenty-one older retail
records (D125–D135) have the same slip and were LEFT ALONE: they predate this
merge, and a merge commit is the wrong place to reformat somebody else's
history.

**Two conflicts, and a third that git hid.** The route matrix and the test-case
catalogue conflicted honestly. The hidden one was worse: both sides had changed
`Total routes: 318` to `320` — for different reasons, two routes each — so git
took `320` silently and the merged truth was 322. Caught by running the tripwire
rather than by reading the diff, which is the entire reason that spec asserts
against the real controller metadata.

The catalogue's two sides both began at PROD-051. Kept both; their 48 rows keep
their numbers and this branch's two moved to PROD-094/095, being the smaller
pair and cited by no spec. The coverage summary was then rebuilt from the rows
themselves rather than patched: it had drifted to 662 against 713 real rows.

**One real break the merge produced, which no conflict marked.** Their D170 made
`positionLabel` a required prop on the pricing step; two of this branch's D152
station tests render that step directly and predate it. Typecheck caught it,
both renders now pass it, and the pair stayed deliberately identical apart from
the business kind so the second remains a control rather than a second scenario.

**`packages/shared` had to be rebuilt.** It is consumed from `dist`, their work
changes the domain capabilities, and the stale build made the api suite fail to
compile on a type it had never heard of. Nothing to do with the merge itself,
and invisible until something asked for it.

**Verified rather than assumed**, as in D158 and D160: every file only they
changed is byte-identical to their branch, every file only this branch changed
is byte-identical to here, no decision heading appears twice, and D135's
supersede pointer still resolves to the record that withdrew it.

Unlike the restaurant branch, this one DID bring its own `testcases.md` rows —
48 of them.

Gates on the merged tree: typecheck 7/7, api unit 1504 across 93 suites, web
unit 1603 across 114 files (2 skipped), integration 1186 across 55 suites, lint
0 errors (13 warnings, all pre-existing). Playwright not run — it needs a live
stack.

### D160 — merging `fix/restaurant-owner-v2` again: the two commits that followed

D158 merged that branch at `985f3b6`. Two more commits landed on it afterwards
— a supervisor can reassign the waiter serving an open table, and the control
that does it became a legible chip — recorded there as D152c and D153–D153b.

**The same collision, one step worse.** Those commits were written on the
branch's ORIGINAL numbering, so they cite D151, D152 and D152b as their own
decisions while this log now means five different things by D150–D154. They
also claim D153, which here is the printed KOT. Renumbered on their side before
merging, as D158 did: D152c → D157c and D153/a/b → D159/a/b.

The letter suffixes stayed attached to their parent rather than being flattened
into fresh numbers. D152c is a correction to their D152 and reads as nonsense
detached from it, so it became D157c; the three D153 records open a new subject
and took the next free number. D158 was already spent on the previous merge's
own record, which is why theirs start at D159.

Re-derived from the branch tip rather than rebased onto the earlier renumber,
so the six records D158 already merged land on identical text and git sees one
change rather than two competing ones.

**Four conflicts, and three of them were the renumber meeting itself.**
`table-floor.tsx`, its my-tables spec and `table-session-panel.tsx` conflicted
because this branch holds their old content renumbered by D158's commit while
the incoming holds their new content renumbered by this one. Their side was
taken whole in each case, on a fact rather than a preference: this branch has
never authored a line in any of the three — every commit touching them is
theirs or a renumber of theirs — and their new tip is a superset of the old.
Checked afterwards that none of the three still cites a retired number.

The fourth was the decision log, and it was an artefact of D158 moving their
records up beside the rest of the recent work: git saw this side delete the
block from the bottom and their side extend it there. Resolved to one copy, in
the moved position, carrying all ten of their records — verified by asserting
no heading appears twice across the whole file.

**Verified rather than assumed**, as in D158: every file only they changed is
byte-identical to their branch, and every file only this branch changed is
byte-identical to here. Their new permission `TABLE_SESSION_REASSIGN` and both
new routes reached the route-module tripwire intact, which is what the api
suite passing proves. D151's removals still hold — no screen names a counter,
the header has no search bar.

**Left undone, for the third time:** their ten decisions ship no `testcases.md`
rows.

Gates on the merged tree: typecheck 7/7, api unit 1480 across 93 suites, web
unit 1463 across 106 files (2 skipped), integration 1165 across 54 suites, lint
0 errors (13 warnings, all pre-existing). Playwright not run — it needs a live
stack.

### D158 — merging `fix/restaurant-owner-v2`: how each clash was decided

Three commits taken on that branch after it forked from this one at `c3c316f`:
the POS becomes the only order-composition screen, a waiter opens on their own
tables and their own orders without being blinded to the rest, and the floor
names the server on every table. Recorded there as D150–D152b. In brief:

**Both branches took D150, D151 and D152**, for entirely different decisions,
because the branch forked before any of them existed and both sides then walked
forward from D149. Theirs moved: D150 → D155, D151 → D156, D151a → D156a,
D152 → D157, D152a → D157a, D152b → D157b — 152 references across 29 files, in
one pass, committed on their side before the merge so the merge itself carried
no renumbering.

This is the opposite call to D149, and for a reason worth writing down. There
the incoming branch was the shared integration branch that other people keep
pushing to, so moving its numbers would have broken work in flight; this branch
is a feature branch that ends at this merge. The rule is not "the pushed side
wins" but "the side that other work still cites keeps its numbers". Their side
was also the smaller sweep, 152 references against 317.

**Nothing else conflicted, and that is a fact about the fork rather than luck.**
Six files were touched by both sides and git merged all six without a marker;
the other 61 were exclusive to one side. Verified rather than assumed: for every
file only they changed the merged tree is byte-identical to their branch, and
for every file only this branch changed it is byte-identical to here. What the
merge actually decided is confined to those six.

**Two overlaps were checked by hand because a clean auto-merge does not mean a
correct one.** The Waiter template gained `TABLE_SESSION_VIEW_ALL` from D156
while already holding `CUSTOMER_MANAGE` from D146; both survive, and D146's
named negatives never included the session key, so the two records do not
contradict each other. And the Orders queue now carries their scope filter on
top of D143a's pagination footer, which coexist.

D151's removals held across the merge: no screen names a counter, the header
has no search bar, and the POS header still names the branch alone.

**A consequence of D155 worth noting against the polling assessment.** Removing
`OrderEntry` removed one of the app's six polling loops with it. The kitchen
board and the Orders queue remain the only two on the restaurant side, and D154
already halved the board's.

**Left undone, as in D149:** their six decisions ship no `testcases.md` rows.
Writing them from outside would be describing what this branch thinks they
built rather than what their authors meant to cover, so the catalogue is short
by however many the waiter-scope work deserves.

Gates on the merged tree: typecheck 7/7, api unit 1472 across 92 suites, web
unit 1452 across 105 files (2 skipped), integration 1165 across 54 suites, lint
0 errors (13 warnings, all pre-existing). Playwright not run — it needs a live
stack.

### D155 — a table's order is taken on the POS; "View order" opens it there

**Asked by the PO, 2026-09-10**, looking at the floor plan: *"View order navigates
to another view — there is no image view there. Remove that and use the POS
view, without the tables, because we already chose one by tapping View order."*

**What was there.** Two order-composition screens for one job. `/pos?mode=dine-in`
(D69/D87) and `/tables/session/[id]` (`OrderEntry`) both built a round for a table
and sent it to the kitchen, and the second one was the older of the two: its menu
was a grid of name-and-price cards, because every POS improvement since had
landed on one screen only. Item photos (D86), server-side search over dietary
tags and subcategories (D45), the sold-out switch (D101), variants in the
Customise dialog (D46), per-line discounts, the cart promotion line (D138) — all
of them are POS-side, and the waiters who take most of a restaurant's orders were
looking at the screen without them.

**Now.** The floor plan's "View order" — on a table card and on every tab of an
arrangement — opens `/pos?mode=dine-in&sessionId=<id>`: the ordinary POS, bound
to that session. The table is not asked for, because tapping that card is the
answer: the picker is absent rather than collapsed, the header names the table
instead of "Counter 1", and the way back is "Back to floor", which is the
navigation the old screen had. `/tables/session/[id]` is kept as a redirect (it
is on the floor's bookmarks) and `OrderEntry` is deleted.

`?sessionId=` was already being WRITTEN before today: the orders queue's "Open in
POS" composes that exact URL, and the POS page read only `?mode=`. That button is
still disabled for a second reason (E18 — `UnifiedOrderView` carries no session
id, so `deriveSessionId` returns `''`), so nobody had reached the hole; the
reading end is now done, and E18 is all that is left between the queue's row and
the table's POS.

**The half the POS was missing.** `OrderEntry` answered a question the POS could
not: *what has this table already got, and where has the kitchen got to with it*.
The bill sheet (D71) prices the order but says nothing about whether it is
cooked, and `ORDER_VOID_SENT` had no home outside the retired screen. Both now
live in "Order so far" on the session strip — rounds newest-first with the
kitchen's status per round and per line, voided lines struck through rather than
dropped, and Void behind the same permission it always had. It polls at the
floor's 8 s while open.

**Two things the strip was getting wrong, fixed with it.** The rounds count was a
counter starting at 0 on every mount, so a table with four rounds told the next
waiter "nothing sent yet" — it is now read from the session detail, excluding
DRAFT rounds. And the table label is resolved in one place
(`lib/restaurant/active-session.ts`, per D28/D31): no endpoint returns it, so it
is composed from the area listings plus the open-tables listing (D49/D50 — an
arrangement belongs to no area and is absent from every per-area read), which the
picker used to do inline and a deep link had no way to reach.

**Deliberately NOT carried over: the D50 release reminder.** `OrderEntry`'s close
interrupted close→bill when the session's arrangement still held tables another
party was using. D105 made a table joinable only while AVAILABLE, so no table can
be a member of two live arrangements, so `stillReserved` is now always empty —
the prompt could not fire. It is not re-implemented on the POS close path, which
never had it.

**Not changed:** the dine-in send, the bill sheet and its split, the permissions
(`ORDER_SEND_TO_KITCHEN` to send, `BILL_SPLIT` to divide, `TABLE_CLOSE` to
close), the floor plan itself, and the food-ready badge and its per-device ack
(D112) — the ack still fires on the same tap, now carrying the waiter into the
POS.

### D156 — a waiter opens on their own tables and can see the floor

**Asked by the PO, 2026-09-10**: *"In waiter view he needs to see his orders by
default in his view, and can also see other orders. Follow the best approach the
industry follows."*

**What was there.** D70 withheld `TABLE_SESSION_VIEW_ALL` from the Waiter
template, so `GET /open-sessions` returned a waiter only the sessions they had
opened, and every session-addressed route answered 404 for anyone else's. Its
reasoning was the mixing: *"a floor list that mixes them is how a table gets
served twice or not at all."*

**Why that was the wrong instrument.** The objection is about DEFAULTS, and it
was answered with blindness. Table service is a shared floor: a waiter covers a
colleague's section during a break, a shift changes mid-service, and a guest
flags down whoever walks past to ask where their starter is. None of that was
possible — not even reading the order to answer the question — and the only way
to see a colleague's table was to walk to a supervisor's screen. Every
mainstream POS (Toast, Square, Lightspeed) ships the opposite shape: the floor
shows everything, the server's own tables are the default view, and a toggle
widens it.

**Now.** The Waiter template carries `TABLE_SESSION_VIEW_ALL`, and both
waiter-facing surfaces default to "mine":

- `/tables` — a **My tables · n / All tables · n** chip pair above the area
  strip (its own row: whose and where are two questions, and D91/D92 settled
  that one strip carries one selection). Under "mine" a colleague's table is
  drawn exactly as it was before — status badge, no View order — so the
  pre-D156 screen is literally the default state.
- The POS dine-in picker — the same two chips over its open-tables strip, and
  the room grid honours them, so an occupied table that is someone else's stays
  greyed until All is chosen.
- Both name the other waiter. `OpenSessionSummary` gained `waiterName` (one
  extra query per page, the same shape the kitchen board's `waiterNames` uses,
  because `TableSession.waiterUserId` is a loose column with no relation): a
  cuid cannot be read out loud, and the users endpoint a client would resolve a
  name through is `USER_MANAGE`-gated.

The default is resolved, not hardcoded: `resolveOwnerScope` opens on "mine"
when the caller has a session of their own and on "all" when they do not, and an
explicit chip wins from then on. Both halves matter — a cashier or an owner owns
no sessions, and defaulting them to "mine" would have replaced their whole-floor
view with an empty screen; a choice that did not stick would be undone by the
next 8 s poll while the waiter was reading a colleague's order.

**What this also opens, deliberately.** `sessionScope()` gates reads AND the
session-addressed writes, so a waiter can now also create an order on, and close,
a colleague's table. That is the point rather than a side effect: a waiter who
can SEE a table and then cannot add the round the guests just asked for has been
handed a door onto a 403, which D93 says not to build. Sending a round never
checked ownership in the first place (only `ORDER_SEND_TO_KITCHEN`), and every
one of these routes is audited with the actor's id — accountability lives in the
audit trail, not in pretending the table is invisible. `ORDER_VOID_SENT` and
`TABLE_TRANSFER`/`TABLE_MERGE` stay absent from the template: seeing a
colleague's table does not make their mistakes yours to erase.

**The scope mechanism stays, and is still tested.** It is keyed on a permission
and a tenant can compose a role without it through RolesApi, so the server-side
narrowing is unchanged. No seeded template lacks the key any more, which would
have left `sessionScope()` asserted in one direction only — so the integration
spec now builds a custom role without it (`TRAINEE_WAITER`) and pins the
narrowing through the same routes, reads and writes both.

**Not changed:** the floor plan's food-ready badge and its per-device ack (D112
— under "all" a colleague's ready food does badge, which is information a waiter
covering them wants), the kitchen board, the orders queue (its rows carry no
waiter attribution today, so it has no "mine" to offer — recorded as a gap, not
a feature), and the bill/split permissions.

**Dev note.** Granting a template permission does not reach an existing
workspace: role ROWS hold the permissions, so
`prisma/backfill-tenant-roles.ts <slug> --write` is what re-applies a template
to a tenant that already exists. Also added `prisma/add-staff.ts`
(`db:add-staff`) — adding a user to an existing tenant had no path at all
(`POST /v1/users` still throws `NotImplementedException`), which is how a
restaurant with one waiter account stays a restaurant with one waiter account.

### D157 — the Orders queue answers "which of these are mine"

**Asked by the PO, 2026-09-10**, correcting D156's reading: *"I told you to check
ORDERS. A waiter handling orders needs to easily check what are HIS orders.
You added it for table management. Check what the industry does for both — is
that even necessary? — and it is needed on the Orders tab."*

**The misread, and what was actually wrong.** D156 put "my tables" on the floor
plan and the POS picker, which is a real control (see below) but not the one
that was asked for. The Orders tab — the live queue a waiter watches to see what
is cooking, ready or unpaid — has always listed the WHOLE branch with no
attribution of any kind: forty rows across three channels, no way to find the
four that are yours, and no column saying whose any of them are. D156's own
record named that gap and left it; this closes it.

**Industry, both surfaces.** Mainstream POS carries the split on both screens
and they answer different questions: Toast's floor plan has a My tables toggle
AND its Orders/Tickets list defaults to the logged-in server; Square for
Restaurants filters tickets by employee; TouchBistro opens a server on their own
tables and their own open tickets. So the floor filter stays — it is the
"where am I working" view — and the queue gets the one this decision is about:
"what is happening to my orders".

**Attribution.** Each queue row now carries `staffUserId` + `staffName`:
- dine-in — the table's waiter (`TableSession.waiterUserId`), falling back to
  the first round's `submittedByUserId` for a session opened without one. The
  order matters: a dine-in order belongs to whoever is SERVING the table, not to
  a colleague who keyed one round while covering.
- takeaway — the first round's submitter, i.e. whoever keyed it at the counter.
- third party — NULL, deliberately. A platform order has nobody behind it, and
  attributing it to whoever is looking would put rows in "my orders" that the
  operator never took. It stays in the branch total and out of "mine".

Names resolve in one query for the page's distinct ids (the same shape
`kitchen.service.waiterNames` uses, and for the same reason: both columns are
loose references with no relation).

**The filter.** `GET …/orders?scope=mine|all`, defaulted BY THE SERVER when the
parameter is absent: mine when the caller has any, all when they do not, and the
envelope says which in `resolvedScope`. Server-side because the list is paged —
a client-side filter would narrow one page of twenty-five and report it as the
total — and because only the server can count the caller's rows in time to pick
the default on the first request, which is what keeps a waiter from watching the
whole room flash past before their own list arrives.

`mineCount` and `allCount` ride in the envelope, counted before the narrowing,
so both chips can carry a number. Everything else — the status tabs, the metric
cards, the ready tally, the pager — is computed AFTER it, because a tab that
counts rows the list is not showing reads as a broken filter.

**On screen.** `ORDERS  [My orders · n] [All orders · n]`, above the channel
chips and below the status tabs, and a row that is not yours carries the name
beside its elapsed time (your own does not: your own name repeated down the
whole list is noise). Verified against the running stack as a waiter: the tab
opens on 2 rows with `My orders · 2` lit and every count reading 2; tapping
`All orders · 36` shows the room, each colleague's row named ("Restaurant
Owner", "Restaurant Cashier"), and writes `?scope=all` so a shared link opens
what the sender saw.

**Not changed:** the queue's permissions (`TABLE_VIEW` + the TABLE_MANAGEMENT
module — everyone who could see the queue still can, and "mine" is a filter
rather than a boundary), the 8 s poll, the drawer, and the D114 ready bell's
rule about which channels count.

**Known limit.** A takeaway order settled by one person and keyed by another is
attributed to whoever keyed it; there is no second staff column to say who took
the money. Fine for the queue's question ("which are mine to chase"), and worth
revisiting only if a shift-report needs the other one.

### D157a — the default must not flicker: "mine" is the state a screen OPENS in

**Reported by the PO, 2026-09-10**, on both surfaces at once: *"Set my orders and
my tables by default. Now when a waiter navigates to Tables and Orders, for a
second it's in All tables / All orders, then navigates to My."*

**The cause, one shape in two places.** Both defaults were computed from a count
that does not exist yet on the first paint:

- the floor plan and the POS picker called `resolveOwnerScope(chosen, mineCount)`
  with a plain number, and before the first response `mineCount` is 0 — which the
  resolver could not tell from "this operator genuinely has no tables", the one
  case that is *supposed* to widen the view. So every arrival rendered ALL and
  snapped to MINE a fetch later;
- the Orders queue seeded `appliedScope` to `'all'` because the server names the
  scope in `resolvedScope` and that has not arrived either.

Neither was a data bug — the lists were right within a few hundred milliseconds.
It was worse than a cosmetic wobble in one way that matters on a tablet: the
first thing a waiter sees on arrival is the room's forty rows, so the screen
teaches them that "All" is where they are, and the counts under it (status tabs,
metric cards) belong to a view they are about to leave.

**Now.** `mineCount` is `number | null`, where null means *not counted yet* and
resolves to `mine`; the two callers pass null while their first load is in
flight (`status === 'loading'` on the floor, the picker's own `loading`). The
Orders queue seeds `appliedScope` from the URL when a shared link names one and
from `'mine'` otherwise. Its chips also hold their counts back until a response
lands — "My orders · 0" before anybody has counted states the till's answer
early.

An explicit choice still wins over "not known yet", so a shared `?scope=all`
link is not narrowed by a slow first load.

**What still flips, and why it must.** Someone who owns nothing — a cashier, an
owner, a waiter before their first table — opens on MINE and widens once the
count arrives. That direction cannot be known any sooner without asking the
server twice, and it lands on the correct view rather than away from it. The
alternative (remembering the last scope per device) was left out deliberately:
it would make the opening view depend on who used the tablet last, which is the
opposite of the request.

**Measured, not reasoned.** Playwright samples the chips every 50 ms from the
first frame on both routes: `/tables` → chips-not-rendered, MINE (no counts),
MINE (My tables · 4 / All tables · 16); `/orders` → chips-not-rendered, MINE,
MINE (My orders · 2 / All orders · 36). No sample reads ALL on the way in. Each
of the three fixes was reverted in turn to confirm the new render cases fail
without it (1 failed, 5 passed, three times).

### D157b — "mine" is the default, and nothing widens it on the operator's behalf

**Reported by the PO, 2026-09-10**, immediately after D157a: *"Now it's working
backward — firstly it navigates to my tables and then automatically to all
tables."*

**Why there were two flickers, not one.** The default was data-driven —
`mineCount > 0 ? 'mine' : 'all'` on the client, and the same test on the server
for the queue — and the count only exists after the first response. D157a fixed
one direction (opening on ALL and snapping to mine, by teaching the resolver
that "not counted yet" is not "empty"). What was left was the other direction,
which fires for anyone who genuinely owns nothing at that moment: a waiter
before their first table, a supervisor, a till. They watched the screen answer
"my tables" and then move itself to "all".

Both were the same mistake: a *default* that keeps thinking after the screen has
already answered the question. The original reason for it — an empty "my tables"
reads as a broken screen — is real, but widening is the wrong remedy, because it
trades a moment's confusion for the operator losing track of which view they are
in (and of what the counts above the list belong to).

**Now.** `resolveOwnerScope(chosen)` takes nothing but the operator's choice and
returns `mine` when there is none; the API's `resolvedScope` is
`query.scope ?? 'mine'`. Neither can move after the first paint, on any data.
`mineCount`/`allCount` are still reported and still drawn on the chips, but they
only label the choice now — they no longer make it.

**The empty state is spoken for, since it can no longer be avoided.**
- The Orders queue, under Mine with nothing of yours: *"None of this branch's
  orders are yours right now."* plus a **Show all N orders** button, which is
  one tap and carries the count that makes it worth taking.
- The POS picker's strip: *"None of the N running tables are yours — tap All to
  see them."*
- The floor plan needs no such line: it draws the room either way (only the
  View-order links are scoped), and the `All tables · 16` chip beside
  `My tables · 0` says where the parties are. Counts now appear on both chips as
  soon as the first load lands, ZERO included — a zero is the answer that used
  to be papered over.

Counts stay absent (rather than showing `· 0`) until that first response, for
the D157a reason: stating an answer before anybody counted is the same class of
lie in miniature.

**Measured on the running stack**, sampling the chips every 50 ms from the first
frame, for both kinds of operator:

    waiter WITH tables  /tables  MINE → MINE (My tables · 4 / All tables · 16)
    waiter WITH tables  /orders  MINE → MINE (My orders · 2 / All orders · 36)
    waiter with NONE    /tables  MINE → MINE (My tables · 0 / All tables · 16)
    waiter with NONE    /orders  MINE → MINE (My orders · 0 / All orders · 36)

No sample reads ALL on the way in, in either direction, for either operator.

**Deliberately not done:** remembering the last scope per device. It would stop
the till re-choosing All every shift, but it would also make the opening view
depend on who used the tablet last — the opposite of "my orders and my tables by
default".

### D156a — the floor names the waiter serving every table

**Asked by the PO, 2026-09-10**: *"In tables, can you add serve waiter name?"*

**What was there.** D156 put a name on a table card only when the session was
NOT the reader's own, reasoning that your own name on your own cards is a word
you already know repeated down the screen. True as far as it goes, and wrong
about what a floor plan is for: it is the shared picture of the room, read over
somebody's shoulder at the pass and by whoever is covering, and one that names
everybody except the reader is a strange thing to hold up. Every mainstream
floor plan (Toast, Square, TouchBistro) puts the server on the table, full stop.

**Now.** Every occupied table carries `👤 <name>` — the physical card under its
seats/elapsed line, an arrangement listing each tab as `Tab: Name`. Two things
about where the name comes from:

- it is read from the UNSCOPED snapshot, so a colleague's table is named even
  under "My tables". What the chip governs is what you can WORK on, not what you
  can see: a named table with no View order beside it is exactly the answer to
  "who do I ask about M3", and it was the old behaviour that made a colleague's
  table go anonymous the moment a waiter narrowed to their own;
- it is null-safe by the same rule as everywhere else (D156): a session with no
  waiter recorded, or one whose user no longer resolves, shows no line rather
  than "Unknown".

`UserRound` rather than the `Users` icon the seat count uses — one counts
covers, the other names a person, and two lines under one icon read as a single
fact split in half.

**Unchanged:** the POS picker still names only the tables that are not yours. A
chip there is 44px of a scrolling strip carrying a table name, an elapsed time
and a cover count already; the reader's own name in that space is the noise
D156 was right about.

### D159 — a supervisor can change the waiter serving a table

**Asked by the PO, 2026-09-10**: *"During serving, someone can complain they need
to change their waiter. Can you add the owner to that option — he can change the
waiter?"*

**The capability.** `POST /v1/restaurant/branches/:branchId/table-sessions/
:sessionId/waiter` moves an OPEN session to another waiter, and
`GET …/assignable-waiters` is the picker's list. Both gated on a NEW permission,
`TABLE_SESSION_REASSIGN` (`table-session:reassign`).

**Why a new key rather than `TABLE_TRANSFER`.** That one is reserved for moving a
table's ORDER to another table — the bill moves with it. Here only the
responsibility moves, and the two want different answers: a shift supervisor who
may re-crew the floor is not automatically someone who may move money between
tables. Keeping them apart also keeps the reserved key's meaning intact for
whoever implements it.

**Who holds it.** OWNER, by definition — the built-in owner set is
`ALL_PERMISSIONS` by reference, so a new key reaches it without a decision.
Deliberately NOT the Waiter template: a waiter may neither hand their table to a
colleague nor take one, the same accountability line that keeps
`ORDER_VOID_SENT` and `TABLE_TRANSFER` off it. A tenant that wants a floor
manager to do this composes a role with the key through RolesApi.

**What moves, and what does not.** Only `TableSession.waiterUserId`. Every round
keeps the `submittedByUserId` it was sent with, so the history still says who
fired which course, and the bill is untouched — this is responsibility from here
on, which is what a guest asking for someone else means. Because the floor plan
(D156), the POS picker and the Orders queue (D157) all read the session's
waiter, the table AND its order move to the new waiter's "mine" and leave the
old one's on the next poll, with no second wiring.

**Who may be given a table** is a permission question, so the list is derived
from ROLE ROWS carrying `ORDER_SEND_TO_KITCHEN` — the very key the round submit
is gated on — scoped to the branch by default branch or an explicit
`BranchAccess` grant. A list built from names or the enum column would
eventually offer somebody the server then refuses. The reassign re-checks
against that same list rather than trusting the client, and refuses with 400
(the user exists; what they lack is a serving role).

**Refusals:** a closed session (nobody to serve, and its bill is raised), a
session on another branch or tenant (404, never a cross-tenant oracle), and a
target who cannot serve.

**On screen.** The served-by name D156a put on each table card gains a
**Change** link for holders of the key; it opens a picker listing the branch's
servers with the current one shown, disabled, as "On this table" — "changing" to
the same person is the one action that would look like it worked and do nothing.
The floor re-reads on success, so the card names the new waiter without a manual
refresh; a server refusal keeps the dialog up with the reason, because a
supervisor mid-service needs to pick again rather than start over.

**Audited** as `TABLE_SESSION_WAITER_REASSIGNED` with both ids — "who was on
this table at the time" is what a disputed bill turns into.

**Dev note.** Adding a permission does not reach an existing workspace: role
ROWS hold them, so `backfill-tenant-roles.ts <slug> --write` re-applies the
templates (the catalogue went 62 → 63 keys). Verified live afterwards: the owner
lists four assignable waiters, a waiter gets 403 on the list, a reassign to a
kitchen user is refused 400, and a real reassign + restore left two audit rows
naming both directions.

### D159a — the picker answers "who has room", not just "who exists"

**Asked by the PO, 2026-09-10**, on seeing the reassign dialog: *"Change waiter
is showing now — but what happens if waiters are more than 10? What is the best
approach?"*

A flat list of names is fine at three and useless at fifteen: the question a
supervisor is actually holding, mid-service, in front of a guest, is not "who
exists" but **"who is here and has room"**. So the list answers that, in the
order the decision is made:

1. **Grouped by whether they are serving**, with each waiter's table count.
   There is no clock-in or shift roster in this schema, so "on the floor" is
   read as "holding an open session on this branch" — the only honest reading
   available, and the same fact the floor plan behind the dialog is showing.
   `GET …/assignable-waiters` gained `openTableCount`, tallied in ONE grouped
   query for the whole list (never one per person). "Serving now · 1 /
   Nimal Perera · 1 table" beside "No tables right now · 2" is the whole
   answer; the count is omitted at zero, because that IS the group.
2. **A search box, but only past six** (`SEARCH_FROM`; eight originally — the
   PO asked twice about big floors, and six is where a tablet's list starts to
   scroll). Below that it would cost a tap and save none. It is deliberately
   NOT auto-focused: on a tablet, focus raises the on-screen keyboard over the
   very list being read, and the commonest action here is tapping a name rather
   than typing one — which is also why search is the FALLBACK for a big team
   rather than the primary control. Filtering is client-side on purpose: this is the
   branch's floor staff — tens of rows, already fetched — and a round-trip per
   keystroke would add latency to a decision being made at the table. A query
   that matches nobody says so, rather than showing an empty panel that reads
   as "this branch has no staff".
3. **A capped, scrolling body** (`max-h-[46dvh]`), so fifteen rows cannot push
   the confirm button off a tablet.

The waiter already on the table moved OUT of the list: shown once at the top as
context ("On this table") rather than as a disabled row, since a candidate list
should contain only candidates.

**Not done, deliberately:** server-side search or paging. At restaurant scale
(tens of staff per branch) it would buy nothing and cost a request per
keystroke. Section/zone assignment — "show me the waiters covering the Terrace"
— would be the genuinely better answer, and it needs a section model that does
not exist; the load count is the useful half of it that today's data supports.

**A real defect this found, mine, caught by its own new test:** grouping the
second list on `openTableCount === 0` while the first used `> 0` left a row
whose count was missing (an older server, a trimmed payload) in NEITHER group —
so it silently vanished from the picker. The second group is now the complement
of the first, and the case is pinned.

### D157c — "my tables / my orders" is the floor's control, not the office's

**Reported by the PO, 2026-09-10**: *"Now the owner is showing the tab as My
orders and My tables — how does that happen? My order / my table is for waiters
only."*

**Correct, and it was a straight miss.** D156 gated the floor's chips on
`TABLE_SESSION_VIEW_ALL`, which reads as "can see other people's tables" and is
therefore held by every supervisor — so the control appeared for the owner too,
and D157b's default then opened them on "My tables · 6": six tables that are
theirs only because they opened them while covering (or while testing). An owner
does not carry a section. "Mine" is a question a SERVER asks.

**The rule.** `supervisesTheFloor(role)` — the enum role, via the same
`isAdminLevelRole` predicate the API uses for "may step past an operational
guard-rail" (OWNER, ADMIN, SALESPERSON). For such a user the floor plan, the POS
picker and the Orders queue all open on the whole branch and **do not render the
chips at all**.

**Why the role and not a permission.** An owner holds EVERY permission,
including the waiter's, so no permission can separate them — the thing that
distinguishes a supervisor is what their job is, and the enum role is where this
codebase records that. Conversely a restaurant Waiter and the restaurant Cashier
both carry the enum `CASHIER` (their real authority is a custom role row), so
both keep the control: the cashier's own takeaway orders genuinely are theirs.

**Not hidden — absent.** The queue's chips are not rendered rather than styled
`hidden`: a control that is merely invisible stays in the tab order and readable
by a screen reader, which makes it a lie about the state rather than an absence.
(Caught by its own test, which found the element the CSS was "hiding".)

The Orders queue asks for `scope=all` EXPLICITLY for a supervisor, because the
server's default is `mine` (D157b) and the client is the only place that knows
whose screen it is.

**Unchanged:** the served-by names (D156a) stay on every card — that is how a
supervisor reads the room — and so does everything about what each role may
*do*. This is a view default, not authorization.

**Verified live:** owner → `/tables` 0 chips / 8 orders reachable, `/orders` 0
chips / 20 rows; waiter → 2 chips on both, 4 tables and 2 orders in the default
view. Mutation-proven: stubbing `supervisesTheFloor` to `false` fails all four
new cases (unit, floor, queue, picker) and nothing else.

### D159b — the Change control is a chip, in the brand pair that survives dark

**Reported by the PO, 2026-09-10**: *"In waiter change button, Change text color
is not visible."*

Two faults, both measured in the browser rather than eyeballed:

- **Contrast.** As bare `text-primary` the link sat at **6.28:1** on the light
  card and **2.49:1** on the dark one — a WCAG AA failure, and exactly the trap
  the Orders status tabs recorded: `--sem-action-primary` is Kinetic Teal in
  BOTH themes while the surface behind it goes dark. Now `bg-brand-100` /
  `text-brand-700`, the pair already validated for that reason
  (`--sem-brand-700` lifts to Flow Aqua under dark): **5.13:1 light, 6.14:1
  dark**.
- **Affordance.** At 12px, weight 500, no underline, immediately after the
  waiter's name in muted grey, it read as part of the NAME rather than as
  something to press — which on a tablet at arm's length is the same as
  invisible. It is now a chip: filled, rounded, `font-semibold`, with its own
  hit area.

The measurement was a one-off (Playwright reading `getComputedStyle` and
computing the WCAG ratio against the first opaque ancestor background), not a
new permanent test: a spec asserting class names would pin the implementation
without proving the contrast, and the honest version of this check needs a
running stack. Recorded here so the next person can repeat it.

### D154 — the kitchen board's tick costs one request, and stops when nobody is looking

PO, 2026-09-10, after asking what websockets would buy here. These are the two
cheap halves of that answer, taken on their own: they cut the board's polling
traffic by well over half, change no architecture, and leave the push question
exactly where it was.

**One request, not two.** The board polled the ticket list and then the lane
counts. The list read now answers with `{ items, counts }` and the second call
is gone. The counts are the BRANCH's lanes and deliberately do not narrow with
`?status=` — D142b's rule is that every chip carries its number whichever lane
is open.

Beyond the halved traffic it is one snapshot, and that is a correctness gain
the traffic argument nearly hid: two reads could disagree about a ticket bumped
between them, leaving the card gone while the chip still counted it. Pinned at
REPEATABLE READ, because Prisma's batch transaction otherwise runs at Postgres
READ COMMITTED where each statement takes its own snapshot — the disagreement
would have been narrowed to microseconds rather than removed, and the comment
claiming otherwise would have been false. Four read-only statements against one
branch take no locks, so it is free.

`GET …/kitchen-tickets/counts` stays. It has its own tests and a route-matrix
entry, and it is a legitimate cheap read for anything wanting numbers alone. It
shares one definition of the three queries with the list read, and an
integration test pins the two exposures to each other so they cannot drift.

`/kds/board` answers with the same envelope. The first cut kept its bare array
on the reasoning that it has no chips, which left two routes serving one service
read in two shapes with nothing pinning the difference on purpose — and made it
pay for three counts it discarded. Nothing consumes that route today, so the
divergence bought nobody anything.

**It stops when hidden**, in exactly the shape the orders queue already used: a
visibility gate on the interval plus `focus` and `visibilitychange` listeners,
so it catches up the moment someone looks rather than waiting out the interval.
A board left open overnight was asking about 1,440 times an hour whether
anything had changed, for nobody.

Two consequences worth recording. The chime pauses with the poll, so a KDS
tablet that sleeps its screen goes silent until it wakes and then rings once for
everything that arrived; that is inherent in what was asked for. And a failed
poll now keeps the last good cards and numbers on screen under a banner rather
than blanking the pass — a wall board showing five-second-old work beats one
showing none.

**That last one introduced a regression, caught by a verifier and not by its
author.** Keeping the rows is right only while the board is asking the SAME
question. After a lane switch it is not: the rows answer the tab the cook just
left, and the lane split relabelled them as the one they chose — a queued card
sitting on Done offering "Start preparing", counted by the Done chip. The board
now remembers which fetch its rows answer and falls through to the error card
when they answer a different one. The banner also clears on the next good poll,
which it never did; that was harmless while a failure blanked the board and
became a permanent red banner over a working pass once it did not.

### D153 — a kitchen ticket can be printed

PO, 2026-09-10, with a sample of the format they wanted. A Print button on every
card on the kitchen board, next to Details.

**Four things left off the sample, at the PO's instruction**, and each is a
deliberate absence rather than an oversight: no "KOT" heading (the paper comes
off the kitchen printer and nothing else does, and the ticket number is the
first thing on it); the table's NAME alone, with no "Table No." label and no
customer (who is sitting there is the floor's business); no "Total Items"
footer. The number column is headed "Item No.", not the sample's "Sl.No".

**One thing added, and it is the reason the paper is worth printing.** Under
each dish go its variation, its modifiers and its special instructions. A count
of lines tells a kitchen nothing it cannot see; "no chilli" is the whole point.
The instruction is marked and set apart from the choices, because on paper an
order and a selection look alike until one of them is labelled.

**The same font as the bill** (PO). A thermal roll is a fixed-pitch device and
every other document off it is monospace, so a sans-serif KOT read as another
system's paper and its columns stopped lining up against the bill beside it.
The bill exports no CSS, so the stack is duplicated in source — and a test reads
BOTH files and compares them, because a font changed on one side only is exactly
the silent divergence that duplication invites.

**Rendered as a pure function, printed through D78's iframe.** `printReceipt`
already owns the frame, the geometry, the image wait and the cleanup, so this is
a string builder plus a one-line caller. That split is what makes the format
assertable without a printer: the only untested part is the browser's own
dialog. The geometry is the tenant's roll (D99), carried in the document's meta
tags, so the width it lays out at and the width it prints at cannot disagree.

Printing is not a state change, and a test says so: the card does not start,
bump or open anything. The button carries the ticket number in its accessible
name, so a board of eight cards offers eight distinguishable Print buttons —
and the spec pins that the button hands the printer ITS OWN ticket, which is the
one defect here that would look entirely correct on screen while the paper came
out for another table.

### D152 — the station split comes back, on the two conditions that make it safe

PO, 2026-09-10: restore the per-station split, and with it "each order grouped by
the station that will be preparing the order"; the station is CHOSEN when a menu
item is created; and there is a station called "Main" that is the default when a
station cannot be decided. This supersedes D147.

**D147 was right about the reason and wrong to be permanent.** Its objection was
never to the split itself — a grill screen showing only grill work is what a
station is for. It was that nothing dependable said which station cooked a dish:
the wizard's multi-select started empty, sat in no validation rule and warned
nobody, so routing ran on an accident. And the accident was destructive: an
unlinked dish at a multi-station branch reached no ticket at all. The PO has now
removed both halves of that objection, so the split returns.

**Nothing can be dropped, and that is structural rather than promised.** There is
no `continue`, no filter and no conditional between resolving an item's targets
and writing its ticket rows. An item whose links give no usable station gets
`[mainStationId]`. D67's sole-station fallback is gone with the drop it excused.

**"Usable" is doing real work there, and two holes were found before it existed.**
Both junctions are tenant-wide and neither is rewritten when a station changes,
so a link can name a station belonging to another BRANCH, or one since ARCHIVED.
Either left the item's station list non-empty, so Main never fired and the ticket
was written to a station this branch's board cannot select — the chip strip lists
only the branch's active stations, and a board pinned to a station shows nothing
else. Ordered, billed, never seen: D147's failure through a different door. Both
link queries now constrain `station: { branchId, isActive: true }`, so an
unusable link leaves the item unrouted and the unrouted path already ends at
Main. Found by an adversarial verifier, not by the change's author.

**Main.** Per branch, `code: 'MAIN'`, name "Main", upserted at round-submit time
rather than assumed, because a branch created before D152 — or one whose seed
never ran — has no such row and a read that came back empty would have to drop
the item or throw. `isActive` is restated on the upsert, since an archived Main
would vanish from the strip while still receiving tickets; the NAME is not, so an
operator's rename survives. Deliberately distinct from the demo's "Main Kitchen".

One consequence to hear once: at a branch with a single station, an unlinked dish
now creates Main rather than going to that sole station, so the chip strip appears
the first time it happens. That follows from the no-drop rule and is not a defect.

**The station is now required on a menu item**, for restaurant tenants only —
a rule that blocked a hardware product on a field it cannot see would be worse
than the gap it closes — and Main is preselected, so the requirement is never an
obstacle: someone who does not care accepts Main and moves on. The wizard now
ALWAYS writes the links, so clearing them actually clears them; it used to skip
the PUT on an empty selection and silently leave the old links in place.

**The column stays nullable.** Tickets cut during the D147 window genuinely
belonged to no station, and inventing one for them would be a lie, so there is no
backfill and every reader still handles null. The ribbon then carries the round
alone; the history prints the table's own em dash; the dialog leaves the line
unlabelled. None of them says "Main", because those tickets held every station's
items.

**Restored from the original commits rather than reinvented** — 35e94fa's ribbon
and 6cbb36a's filter strip, comments included, adapted where the ground had
moved. Everything gained in between survives and was mutation-proved
individually: ae11a7d's card layout, D142b's lane counts, D142's today-only Done
lane and its history link, D150's every-lane history.

One collision needed a call. D142b puts a count on every lane chip; 6cbb36a says
the lane counts follow the station cut. They meet on the lane the board is not
fetching, whose count comes from the server and is branch-wide. Under a cut that
chip now goes bare rather than promising a lane the cook cannot reach. On every
unfiltered board all three numbers behave exactly as D142b left them.

The history keeps everything D150 gave it and regains its Station column and the
station leg of its search.

### D151 — the header loses its search bar, and the screen stops naming a counter

Two PO requests on 2026-09-10, both removals of things that were taking up room
without earning it.

**No search bar beside the theme toggle.** The header carried a "Search or jump
to… ⌘K" button. It is gone. The palette is NOT gone: `CommandPalette` is now
headless — it mounts the Ctrl/Cmd+K listener and the dialog and draws nothing
until asked. The request was about the bar, and the two are separable; the
keyboard route costs no header space, which is what was being reclaimed.

What it costs is discoverability, and that is worth saying plainly: nothing on
screen now advertises that Ctrl+K exists, so anyone who does not already know
will not find out. UI-013 and UI-014 still describe the shortcut and still
pass. If the palette should go entirely, that is a second decision and a
larger one — the gate, the command list and their specs all hang off it.

`show()` went with the button rather than being left as an opener nothing
calls, and a render spec now pins both halves: the component renders literally
nothing, and the shortcut still opens, closes, toggles and navigates. Each
half is the other's positive control, which is what keeps "renders nothing"
from passing for a component that was gutted.

**No counter on any screen.** The POS header read "Main Dining · Counter 1".
The PO's reason: counters are not tracked in this system, so the second half
was a seed value dressed as context. `registerName` is dropped from `PosShell`
entirely rather than left unused, so no counter is threaded through the POS at
all; the service dashboard's header loses the same suffix, and the retail
cashier hero loses both the "Counter 1 is ready…" greeting and the register
meta chip.

**The branch name STAYS.** A Branch is a real record with real data hanging off
it, and on a multi-branch tenant it is the one piece of context that answers
"whose till am I looking at". Only the register half was fiction. If the branch
should go too, say so — it is one string per screen.

Two things deliberately untouched. The cashier dashboard's "Register Health"
card shows shift state and QuickBooks sync, never a register NAME, so it is
about tracked state and stays. And `registerName` still reaches the printed A4
document through `document-template-service`; a document recording which till
took a sale is a different question from a page header decorating itself, and
changing what a document prints is its own decision (D16).

### D150 — the ticket history holds every lane, not only Done

PO, 2026-09-10: "To make and preparing tickets are not showing in the ticket
history."

One clause caused it. `listHistoryForBranch` carried `status: COMPLETED`, so a
screen advertised as the kitchen's record only ever held bumped tickets; a
queued or in-progress ticket appeared NOWHERE — not on the history, and on the
board only until someone changed lanes. The lanes are the BOARD's split, a way
of organising work in front of a cook. They were never meant to divide the
kitchen's record, and D142 did not intend this.

**Order.** A pending ticket has no `completedAt` to sort by, so the list is
`completedAt DESC NULLS FIRST, createdAt DESC, id DESC`: unfinished first,
newest-raised first within that block, then finished newest-first, with the id
keeping the order total so a page boundary can neither repeat nor skip a row.
Live work at the top rather than interleaved by raise time, because the list
pages twenty at a time and a ticket still on the pass buried three pages back
is the thing this change was asked to surface. Postgres already defaults DESC
to NULLS FIRST; the clause is spelled out so the intent survives a refactor,
and the spec fails if it is removed.

The consequence, accepted: the pending block is unbounded and sits above all
finished work. A branch carrying stale never-bumped tickets pins them to page
one indefinitely. That is the trade — a stuck ticket at the top is a thing
someone should see.

**What did not move.** No date bound, which is the whole point of the screen
(D142). The D115 cancellation exclusions, all three legs. The Done LANE, still
cut to the shop's own day. The search legs, the paging and the view mapping.

**A test gap this change created and closed.** While the read said `COMPLETED`,
a cancelled takeaway whose ticket was never bumped was held out for free by the
status clause. Widening removed that cover and made the takeaway-profile leg
of D115 load-bearing for the first time — and nothing asserted it: deleting it
left every unit and integration test green. Two independent verifiers found the
same surviving mutant. The D115 unit test now asserts the exact pair, and the
mutant dies. This is the D30 failure mode exactly: an exclusion that would pass
if it were deleted.

No index was added for the new sort over a now strictly larger set, and no
migration was made — the repo forbids one without a decision record, and this
is not that record.

### D149 — merging `merge/restaurant-changes`: how each clash was decided

The ten commits that landed on the integration branch while this one was open
(2026-09-09): four promotions decisions recorded there as D138–D141, a rewrite
of the categories screen, a toolbar on `Dialog`, and three kitchen-board
commits. Merged at `631f502`. In brief:

**Both branches took D138–D141.** Theirs keep them: they are already on the
shared branch and other people's commits cite them. This branch had never been
pushed, so it moved — every record here shifted up by four (D138 → D142 …
D144 → D148), 261 references across 72 files, in one pass so a rule could not
feed its own output. Their citations and ours now resolve to different records
with no overlap.

**The station contradiction is the one thing this merge could not settle.**
Two of their three kitchen commits are built ON the per-station split: the
ribbon (35e94fa) exists to tell a cook which of several cards for one table is
theirs, and the filter (6cbb36a) exists because "a station-split order already
puts one table on several cards". D147 removed the split. After it every
ticket carries `stationId: null`, so the ribbon would print nothing and every
filter chip would count zero and hide the board. They cannot both ship.

Resolved PROVISIONALLY in favour of D147, because it is the most recent product
decision and was given directly after the PO saw the symptom, and because it
also closed a defect their work does not address: at a branch with two or more
stations an unlinked dish reached no ticket at all. Their ribbon, their chip
strip, its per-branch memory and its chime scoping are removed from the working
tree and preserved in history at those two shas. **This is the PO's call to
confirm, not ours** — recorded here so the choice is visible rather than buried
in a merge diff.

Their third kitchen commit, ae11a7d, is pure layout and has nothing to do with
stations. It survives whole, and the resolution was built by starting from
THEIR file and removing the station affordances rather than porting their work
onto ours, precisely so none of it was lost by hand. Two verifiers walked every
line they added; one found a real loss — 35e94fa pinned that a ticket predating
rounds must not print a bare "Round", the guard moved into the subtitle join we
kept, and the test went out with the ribbon suite that happened to hold it. The
test is restored, and the mutant that survived without it now dies.

**Everything else auto-merged and was checked rather than trusted.** `Dialog`
carries their toolbar and our centring together. `types.ts` took their
promotion fields beside our `stationId` comment. Their 188-line rewrite of
`table-sessions.service.ts` never touched the kitchen call, so D147's rename
survived at both call sites. Their branch introduced no native dialog, so D145
holds across the merge.

**`shared-subcategory-library.tsx` was a modify/delete and their delete wins.**
Their categories rewrite replaced it and `lib/category-assignments.ts`
outright, and nothing imports either afterwards. Our only change to it was the
D145 modal conversion, which is moot once the file is gone; the spec we wrote
for it went with it.

**One spec of ours was a genuine casualty.** Their counter now prices its own
draft through `applyPromotions` over rules the catalogue ships, and our D145
spec's catalogue mock predates that key, so the component threw before it
rendered. The mock supplies an empty rule set — the questions the app asks
before discarding a cart are the subject, and a live promotion would put a
discount line in every total those tests read.

**Left undone, deliberately:** their four decisions ship no `testcases.md`
rows. Writing them from the outside would be guessing at what their authors
meant to cover, so the catalogue is short by however many the promotions work
deserves.

Gates on the merged tree: typecheck 7/7, api unit 1438 across 89 suites, web
unit 1337 across 98 files (2 skipped), integration 1158 across 54 suites, lint
0 errors (13 warnings, all pre-existing). Playwright not run — it needs a live
stack.

### D142 — the kitchen board keeps today; the kitchen's history gets its own screen, and the pass loses the dashboard

Three things the kitchen asked for, and they are one change: the Done lane had
become a scroll of everything the branch had ever cooked, there was nowhere to
look up a ticket from last week, and the one screen kitchen staff work was
reached past a dashboard showing them every table in the restaurant.

**Done means today, and the shop decides when today is.** The lane asks for a
new pseudo-filter, `COMPLETED_TODAY`, beside `OUTSTANDING` and `CANCELLED`
(D68, D115). `COMPLETED` itself is untouched: the KDS route, a bookmarked
query and the history screen all still mean "every ticket ever bumped" by it.
Widening the existing token in place would have left the four integration
assertions that read `?status=COMPLETED` green while they quietly stopped
proving anything — their tickets are completed seconds before they are read, so
they cannot tell a today-scoped list from an unscoped one (D30).

The window is `[midnight, next midnight)` in the TENANT's zone, resolved on the
server per request — `lastNDaysInTimeZone(1, safeTimeZone(settings.timezone))`,
the same read the dashboard's "today" makes. Three reasons it is not the
browser's day: a kitchen screen is a wall-mounted tablet whose clock nobody
audits; the board polls every five seconds and never reloads, so a window
captured at mount would keep last night's tickets until somebody touched it,
while one recomputed per request empties the lane at the shop's midnight
unattended; and cutting on the SERVER's midnight would, on a UTC host serving a
Colombo kitchen, hold last night's tickets on the lane until half past five in
the morning. `KitchenModule` gains `SettingsModule` for it — Settings imports
only AuditLog, which imports nothing, so the graph stays a DAG.

D47's "the API lists by explicit `[from, to)` supplied by the client — the
server does not guess the display timezone" is not contradicted: that rule is
about a RANGE the operator chooses (the reservation book's day, the orders
queue's window). "Today" here is not a chosen range but a property of the
business, which is why the dashboard already resolves it the same way.

**The history is the board's own rows, read back later.**
`GET /restaurant/branches/:branchId/kitchen-tickets/history` — KOT_VIEW and the
KITCHEN module, like the board: reading what was cooked is the same claim
whether it happened ten minutes or ten weeks ago. It pages and searches in SQL
on the shared pager (page/pageSize/`Paginated`), because the set only grows;
the board's own list stays an unpaged array, which is why this is a sibling
route rather than an option on the existing one. Search covers the four things
a person actually remembers — the ticket number, the order it belonged to,
where it was going (tab, table code, area) and what was on it — plus the
station. Cancelled work is excluded on D115's reasoning: a record of what the
kitchen COOKED should not be padded with what it was told to stop cooking.

**Today's tickets are in the history too**, deliberately. The lane and the list
overlap; splitting them cleanly by date would make the ticket bumped an hour
ago findable in neither place once the lane scrolled, which is the failure the
screen exists to prevent. The Done lane carries a link to it, because the cook
who fails to find last night's ticket is looking at the lane, not at the rail.

**Kitchen staff lose the dashboard.** The service dashboard is a floor board:
open tables, bills requested, tables needing attention, with the kitchen queue
as one tile of four. It was the only destination in the product with no gate at
all, so it reached the one role whose template deliberately holds no `TABLE_*`,
no `ORDER_*` and nothing with money in it — and, because the tables and areas
reads only require `PLATFORM_PROFILE_READ`, it showed them the real floor
rather than failing shut. The entry is now gated ANY-of on
`[TABLE_VIEW, SALE_READ, REPORT_READ]` (D93): what the board actually shows,
named as three capabilities rather than one proxy. Every food-service and hotel
template holds at least `TABLE_VIEW`; `KITCHEN_STAFF` holds none of the three,
and that is the whole of the change. The rail for kitchen staff is now exactly
`Kitchen · Ticket history`.

Three alternatives were rejected. A new `DASHBOARD_VIEW` permission would strip
the dashboard from every TENANT-CREATED role silently and permanently, since
`seedTenantRoles` only ever writes template keys and `PermissionResolver`
refuses to union a role row with the enum defaults — a custom "Head chef" role
would lose a screen nobody changed. A role-name check contradicts D28/D31 and
would not survive the enum, which stores every restaurant template as `CASHIER`
(`baseUserRoleFor`). Gating the RETAIL Dashboard the same way is deliberately
NOT done: no retail role is in this position, and the rail's fail-open tripwire
needs one genuinely ungated destination to be worth anything.

**Where they land instead.** Login, `/` and the module gate's "back to safety"
link all point at `/dashboard`. `redirectFor(groups, pathname)` — a pure
resolver beside `moduleForPath`, in the shape D28/D31 asks for — answers where
to send someone whose own rail does not offer the destination they landed on,
and `null` in the three cases that matter: an UNRESOLVED rail (which is also
what an error renders — never redirect on a guess, D31), a destination that IS
theirs, and a rail with nothing to redirect to. Its one caller today is the
dashboard page; kitchen staff land on the board.

**Two D30 tripwires were re-armed rather than relaxed.** The rail's fail-open
tripwire proved its point by exactly one ungated label surviving a user who
holds nothing; with the food-service Dashboard gated its restaurant half would
have asserted `[]`, which satisfies every "must not contain" below it. It now
pairs the empty rail with a one-permission positive control (`KOT_VIEW` opens
exactly Kitchen and Ticket history) and keeps the genuinely ungated retail
Dashboard as the other half. The command palette's KITCHEN_STAFF negative used
the ungated `dashboard` command as its positive control; it is re-armed on the
new `kitchen-history` command, which that role does hold, with the dashboard's
absence added as a named negative and a waiter's access to it as the proof the
gate discriminates.

The lane also stops sorting by when a ticket was RAISED. "What have we
finished today" is answered newest-finished first, so `COMPLETED_TODAY` orders
on `completedAt`; a ticket raised at 11:00 and bumped at 14:00 belongs above one
raised at 13:00 and bumped at 13:30, which `createdAt` had backwards. The
unscoped `COMPLETED` list keeps its old order, so nothing reading it changes.

**Three consequences, named rather than discovered later.**

*Recall reaches only today.* D100's recall is offered on the Done lane, which
now holds one day — so a bump from before the shop's midnight can no longer be
taken back through the UI. Deliberate: recalling yesterday's ticket would put
stale work back on the pass, and a wrong bump is noticed in minutes, not days.
The history screen therefore offers no verbs at all; it is a record.

*A service that runs past midnight loses its lane mid-shift.* A kitchen still
plating at 00:05 sees the Done lane empty and refill from zero. That is what
"today" means, and the lane says so ("Nothing finished today yet. Earlier
tickets are in Ticket history") with the link beside it. A shift-based window
would be a different feature — it needs to know when service started, which
nothing records.

*The timestamps on both kitchen screens are still the VIEWER's.* Only the day
boundary is the tenant's. On a tablet set to the shop's own zone — every real
kitchen — the two agree; a laptop in another zone can show a stamp whose date
looks a day off from the lane it is on. Matching the existing convention
(`AppSettings.timezone` is documented as the zone printed DOCUMENTS use, while
on-screen datetimes use the viewer's), not worth a divergence here.

**Not changed.** The board's three lane names, its chime, its bump verb, the
KDS route, the floor's "food is ready" badge (D112 reads COMPLETED tickets
through its own Prisma query, not this endpoint), and the retail rail. No
migration: `KitchenTicket.completedAt` has existed since the column and the
`COMPLETED` enum value shipped in one migration, and `completeTicket` /
`reopenTicket` are the only writers, so a COMPLETED row always carries the
timestamp the window filters on.

**No index, and what that actually costs.** `KitchenTicket` has
`@@index([branchId])` and nothing on `completedAt`, so the history's
`ORDER BY completedAt DESC` is a sort over the branch's matching rows, and the
`count` beside it scans them again — the index narrows the set but cannot serve
the order. That is acceptable at a branch's realistic volume (a busy kitchen
writes a few hundred tickets a week) and it is the honest reason, not "the
existing index carries it". A composite `(tenantId, branchId, completedAt)`
index is the fix when a branch's history gets long enough to feel it; it is a
migration and therefore its own decision, with a measurement attached.


### D148 — the reservation book reaches the service dashboard, and the dashboard fits

PO decision, 2026-09-09: "include a card that shows the upcoming reservations.
Make sure that the new card does not make the dashboard scrollable. Instead
everything should fit into the dashboard." Extended in the same session to the
owner.

**One card, three roles, no new dispatch.** The dashboard router picks on
BUSINESS TYPE before it looks at a role, so in a table-service tenant the owner,
the waiter and the restaurant cashier all land on the same service dashboard.
Adding the card there is what "add it for the waiter and the cashier" and "add
it for the owner too" both mean; no per-role branch was written, and none
should be. All three templates already carry `RESERVATION_VIEW` (the owner by
holding everything), which the spec asserts from the REAL templates rather than
from sets it invents, so removing the key from the waiter fails a test instead
of quietly emptying the card.

**The window starts NOW, not at the top of the day.** A card headed "upcoming"
whose first three rows are already seated is worse than no card. The list
returns everything intersecting the window, so a booking that started ten
minutes ago and has not been seated is still on it — which is the one the host
most needs. Closed bookings are never requested, so a cancellation or a no-show
cannot occupy a row.

**Missing permission is its own state, not an empty card.** Someone without
`RESERVATION_VIEW` is told the book is not theirs. An empty card asserts "no
bookings tonight", and a host who believes that gives the table away; the two
must not look alike. The server refuses the read either way — this is
usability, as D31 has it, not security.

**Fitting is a property of the layout, not of the card count.** The shell
already gives `main` the only vertical scroll and a definite height, so the
page is bounded to what it is given, the panel row absorbs the slack, and each
panel scrolls INSIDE its own card. Adding a fourth panel then costs width and
never height — which is the only way "one more card" can be a safe thing to
say. Four rules carry that (`lg:h-full` on the page, `lg:flex-1` and
`lg:auto-rows-fr` on the row, `lg:overflow-y-auto` on each body); each is
asserted by its own test, and removing any ONE of them puts the scrollbar back
while the other three still read correctly.

Because the cards scroll themselves, the lists are no longer sliced to the
first six or eight. Truncating hid work from the people the board is for.

Height-constrained from `lg` up only. On a phone the summary tiles alone are
taller than the viewport and four quarter-height panels would be unreadable, so
there the page scrolls, which is the right answer at that width.

### D147 — a round is one ticket, because nobody can say which station cooks what

PO decision, 2026-09-09. Reported as "I added a huge order RO-000026, why did it
break into 2 tickets in the kitchen page? It should be one single ticket because
it is a single order for a single round."

It split because D67 cut ONE TICKET PER STATION and kept doing so after D68
replaced the printer with a board. That was right when a station meant a
printer: the grill's paper could not also come out of the main kitchen's
machine. On one shared screen it buys nothing, and it costs the pass the thing
it most needs, which is the order as the guests will receive it. RO-000026 was
one round of 15 lines and became KOT-000027 (Main Kitchen, 13) and KOT-000028
(Grill, 2: Chicken Wings, Grilled Seer Fish).

**The routing input is optional and defaults to nothing, which is the PO's
actual reason.** A "Kitchen stations" multi-select does exist, on Step 3 of the
product wizard, for restaurant tenants; it is branch-scoped and falls back to
the signed-in user's branch, so for most users it does list the stations. But
`kitchenStationIds` starts as `[]`, appears in no validation rule, and carries
no warning, so a product saved without deliberately ticking a station has no
link — and nothing on the screen says that this is the difference between a
dish the kitchen sees and one it does not. Routing that decides whether food
gets cooked cannot hang on a checkbox nobody is told to tick.

**And the accident was silently destructive.** Read the D67 fallback it
replaces: an item with no station link went to the sole active station, and
where a branch had two or more, it went to NO ticket and was logged. The pilot
branch has four (Bar, Grill, Main Kitchen, Pastry). So an unlinked dish was
ordered, billed, and never shown to the kitchen — the exact failure D67's own
comment called indefensible, reintroduced by the same mechanism one layer up.
One ticket per round ends it structurally: there is no routing step left to fall
off. This is the strongest argument for the change and it was not the one that
prompted it.

**`KitchenTicket.stationId` becomes nullable rather than dropped.** Tickets cut
before today were genuinely routed and keep the station they were routed to;
every ticket written from now on stores NULL. The migration only removes the NOT
NULL, so no value moves and the foreign key is untouched.

`generateTicketsForRound` is renamed `generateTicketForRound` and returns one id
or null. The plural was about to become a lie, and neither call site read it.

**The station catalogue, the links and the wizard control all stay.** They are
no longer consulted at ticket time, which leaves the wizard's multi-select
writing rows nothing reads — a loose end recorded here rather than quietly
tidied, because removing a control the PO has not asked about is not this
decision's business. Either give stations a job again or take the control out;
both are open.

The board and the history stop naming a station anywhere: the card subtitle, the
history column, the per-item chip in the order dialog, and the history search
leg. A field that is null on every new row is not worth a column.

### D146 — the waiter may record who a takeaway is for

D87 gave the waiter takeaway orders: a seated guest asking for something to take
home is still the waiter's order to take. The counter's customer popup then asks
for a name and a phone and POSTs a customer — which the waiter could not do. The
403 surfaced as "You don't have permission to create a customer. Ask a manager,
or Skip to continue as walk-in", so the one person holding the phone could raise
the order and then only finish it as a walk-in.

`CUSTOMER_MANAGE` is wider than "create", and that is granted knowingly. It is
the ONLY customer-write key — there is no `CUSTOMER_CREATE` — and the
permissions guard is all-of (`required.every(...)`), so a narrower key would
need the route to accept either, which the guard cannot express today. It
therefore also carries editing an existing customer and the bulk importer. The
restaurant cashier standing at the same counter already holds exactly this key,
so it adds no authority to the workspace that the floor did not already have.

**What the waiter still may not do is unchanged** and is asserted as named
negatives beside the grant: no `PAYMENT_COLLECT`, no `SALE_READ`, no
`REPORT_READ`, no `SETTINGS_MANAGE`, no `USER_MANAGE`, no `ORDER_VOID_SENT`.
Verified against the running API: the waiter's token now creates a customer
(201) and is still refused a payment (403).

A live tenant needs its role rows re-seeded before this reaches anyone —
`seedTenantRoles` writes template permissions with `set`, so the pilot wants
`prisma/backfill-tenant-roles.ts --write` (or a seed run, which is what the dev
database got).

### D145 — the app asks its own questions

`window.confirm` and `window.prompt` are drawn by the BROWSER, so they carry
neither the app's theme nor its wording, they cannot be made touch-sized on the
tablets the POS runs on, Chrome suppresses them after a few in a row, and they
BLOCK the main thread — the kitchen board's five-second poll and the cart's
midnight rollover both stall behind one open confirm. Nine call sites used them:
seven confirms and two prompts.

`ConfirmProvider` mounts one dialog in the authenticated shell and hands out
`useConfirm()` and `usePrompt()`, both promise-based. That shape is the point:
every call site keeps its exact form —

    if (!(await confirm({ title: 'Discard this basket?' }))) return;

— so converting nine guards could not quietly change what any of them protected.
Local dialog state at each site would have meant splitting nine handlers into an
opener and a callback, which is nine chances to drop a branch.

Escape, the overlay and Cancel all resolve the way the native dialogs did:
`false`, and `null` for a prompt. A destructive question opens with CANCEL
focused rather than the confirm — native `confirm` focuses OK, and on a tablet a
stray Enter mid-sentence deleted the thing. `useConfirm` outside the provider
THROWS rather than falling back to `window.confirm`: a silent fallback would
reintroduce exactly what this replaces, on whichever screen forgot the provider.

**Modals are centred at every width** (PO). `Dialog` was a bottom sheet below
`sm` and a centred card above it; a modal that asks a question belongs in the
middle of the screen wherever it is read, and on a wall-mounted tablet the
bottom edge is the furthest thing from the reader's eye.

**`Sheet` too — the first pass scoped this too narrowly.** It was left alone
here on the reasoning that an edge-anchored panel is what a sheet is FOR. The
PO reported it again against the dine-in bill, which filled the window top to
bottom with the scrim showing only above it, and they are right: a wide working
panel is still a popup, and the rule was about popups, not about one component.
`Sheet` is now centred, and the grab handle, the top-only rounding and the
footer's safe-area inset went with the anchor — each existed only because the
panel touched the bottom edge. Its slide-up entrance became a grow-in, since a
panel that rises from the edge and stops in the middle reads as an animation
that failed. The name is now a small lie, kept only because renaming reaches
eleven call sites for no behavioural gain.

**Three surfaces are still edge-anchored, deliberately.** `Drawer` and the
orders-page order detail are right-side slide-overs whose content assumes full
height; the command palette opens near the top, which is what every palette
does and where the eye goes on `Cmd+K`; and the retail POS cart is a
bottom-anchored panel below `lg` only, on a phone, where a cart drawer is the
convention and there is no room to float. None of these is a question being
asked, which is what the rule is about. Recorded so the omission is a decision
rather than an oversight — the first pass's mistake was leaving one unrecorded.

The nine sites: the counter workspace's clear-draft and clear-all, the retail
cart's Clear, a held basket's Discard, closing a dine-in table with unsent
lines, deleting a shared subcategory, resetting document settings, and the
variant matrix's two bulk actions (the prompts). Each was converted with its
guard left as untouched context in the diff, so the `raw == null` the reorder
bulk action needs — blank means "clear it", dismissal means "leave it" — did
not collapse into `!raw`. Mutation-proved (D30): seven mutants of `confirm.tsx`
against `confirm.render.test.tsx` and three of the centring against
`dialog.render.test.tsx`, all killed; the per-site specs carry their own.

### D144 — the brand mark follows the theme, because one asset cannot serve both

The app chrome used a single logo, `/brand/axlo-icon.svg`, whose two chevrons
are filled `#fff`. On the dark rail that reads; on the light rail — `bg-surface`
resolves to white — the chevrons are white on white and the mark degrades to a
bare gradient slash. The PWA icon `/web-app-manifest-512x512.png` is the same
artwork inked `#000718`, i.e. the light-surface twin.

`BrandMark` renders both and swaps them with the `dark:` variant, which
globals.css binds to `[data-theme='dark']`. In CSS rather than in JavaScript on
purpose: the theme attribute is set by the inline init script before first
paint, so the right mark is painted immediately, there is nothing to rehydrate,
and a hook could not have rendered the same thing on the server and the client.
It is the first `dark:` utility in the app — everything else themes through
semantic tokens — which is exactly what that variant was declared for.

**The mapping is the opposite of the way it was asked for, and the ink is why.**
The request was to use the manifest PNG *in dark mode*; its chevrons are
`#000718` against a `#1a2433` surface, which would have replaced an invisible
mark with a different invisible mark. Light gets the dark ink, dark gets the
white ink. Flipping it is one line if the intent really was the other way.

**The padding had to be trimmed, and this is the part worth remembering.** A PWA
icon is 512×512 with the mark across the middle 67% and empty space above and
below, which a launcher needs. Used raw at `h-9 w-auto` that drew a 36×36 box
holding a 24px-tall mark next to a 36px-tall one — a third smaller, in a box
17px narrower, so the wordmark beside it shifted on every theme flip. The
screenshots looked fine one at a time, which is how it survived the first pass;
measuring the rendered boxes is what caught it. `/brand/axlo-icon-light.png` is
that artwork with the transparent padding cropped, so both assets carry the same
ink aspect (1.483 against 1.482) and one class sizes them identically — measured
at 53.4×36 in both themes. The manifest file is untouched: its padding is
correct for what it is, and pointing a logo slot at an OS icon would have made
any future icon change silently resize the chrome.

**The login screen keeps the raw white asset**, and must. Its panels are
hard-coded `bg-[#161d2f]` and `bg-[#1b2236]` in both themes, so a theme-aware
mark there would blank the logo for a light-mode visitor — the same trap in
reverse.

### D143a — every list gets the same footer, and the kitchen's record gets a better name

Three things, all in the same direction: one pagination footer, everywhere.

**Quotations and Suppliers gained a rows-per-page control.** Both had a page
size fixed in code (25 and 20) and so rendered no selector. They now hold the
size in state like every other list and start on 20, which also retires the
last page size in the product that no footer offered.

**The restaurant orders queue uses the SHARED footer.** It was the one screen
with its own — a rows-per-page select, "Showing 1–25 of 80 orders", and bare
Previous/Next — which is what `testcases.md` UI-021 forbids anywhere and what
kept O7 open. It now renders `Pagination` like the rest: numbered pages, the
same range wording, the same control. The word "orders" leaves the range text;
the `truncated` warning below it is unchanged.

**And it renders even when everything fits one page**, which answers O7 the way
every `main` list already answers it. This is the half that was actually
reported: the queue hid the whole footer below 21 rows, so on a branch with
eight orders the rows-per-page options were unreachable and looked absent. The
paging steps go disabled rather than disappearing, so the row keeps its width.

**"Kitchen history" is now "Ticket history".** The rail already says Kitchen
directly above it, so the old label repeated its parent — which is also why the
sidebar's double-highlight (D142a) showed up there first and why its tests need
anchored queries. "Ticket" is the kitchen's own word for the thing the screen
lists, the same reasoning D103 used in choosing "Menu". The route stays
`/kitchen/history`: it is still the kitchen's history, the nesting is what earns
the KITCHEN module gate for free, and a URL is worth more stable than tidy.

**Neither kitchen screen leads with the branch name any more.** They read
"Main Dining — live tickets…" and "Main Dining — every ticket finished here…",
which named a dining AREA on the two screens that have nothing to do with one.
The pass is not a room; the subtitles now say what the screen is for.

### D143 — one rows-per-page list: 20, 50, 100

PO, 2026-09-09. Three lists had drifted apart — the shared `10/20/30/50`, the
retail till's own `20/30/40/50` and the orders queue's `25/50/75/100` — so the
same control offered different numbers depending on which screen it sat on.
There is now one list, in `components/ui/pagination.tsx`, and the two local
copies are deleted rather than edited to match: a second copy is how they
diverged in the first place.

**The first entry is the default every list starts on**, so it has to stay the
smallest. A screen defaulting to a size the options do not contain renders a
`<select>` whose value matches no `<option>`, and the browser then shows the
first one — a footer claiming 20 rows over a page of 25. Every screen with a
size control already defaulted to 20; the orders queue's 25 moved with it, which
also means a bookmarked `?size=25` degrades to the default instead of being
honoured. The two lists with no size control at all (quotations at 25,
suppliers at 20) are untouched: no options to standardise, and changing a fixed
page size is a different decision.

**Found while testing it:** the shared control had no accessible name — the
words beside it are a plain `<span>`, not a `<label>` — so every list footer in
the product announced an unnamed combobox. The orders queue's own copy had
always carried `aria-label="Rows per page"`; the shared one now does too.

The tests assert the WIRING as well as the constant, because asserting the
exported list alone would have said nothing about the two screens that rendered
their own.

### D142b — every lane chip carries a number, whichever lane is open

The board fetches ONE lane's tickets at a time — To make and Preparing share
the outstanding list, Done is its own read — so it could only count the lane it
was looking at. From To make, the Done chip carried no number; from Done, To
make and Preparing carried none. Reported as "Done has no count", which is the
half a cook standing at the pass sees.

Fetching both lists every poll was the obvious fix and the wrong one: the Done
list is a whole day of tickets with their items, and pushing that down every
five seconds to render one integer is exactly the payload a wall tablet on shop
wifi cannot spare. Instead
`GET /restaurant/branches/:branchId/kitchen-tickets/counts` returns all three as
three `count`s in one transaction — consistent with each other as well as with
the lists, where two separate queries could count a ticket bumped between them
twice or not at all.

**The counts cannot drift from the lanes**, because the `where` ladder that
defines each lane was extracted (`whereForFilter`) and both readers use it. To
make and Preparing are the client's split of OUTSTANDING, so the counts narrow
that same clause by status rather than restating it; Done reuses the day window.
Two copies of "what is outstanding" is how a chip comes to promise three tickets
the list does not have.

**The lane you are looking at still counts itself.** A chip whose lane shares
the current fetch is derived from the list already in hand, so an optimistic
bump moves both outstanding chips at once instead of lagging up to five seconds
behind the poll; only the lanes the board is not fetching read the server's
numbers. Both halves are mutation-proved: reverting to the old rule fails the
three-chip tests, and reading the server for every lane fails the optimistic one.

The counts request is best-effort and fires after the list. A chip without a
number is a smaller problem than a board that will not load, so a failing count
leaves the last known numbers on screen and never takes the tickets down with
it.

### D142a — the rail marks one place, and a history row opens the whole order

Three things the kitchen asked for after using D142.

**One entry is current, not two.** The sidebar marked every entry whose href is
a PREFIX of the path, which was invisible while no destination was nested and
wrong the moment one was: standing on `/kitchen/history` lit up Kitchen and
Ticket history together, and `aria-current="page"` on two links tells a screen
reader the reader is in two places. `activeNavHref(groups, pathname)` — a pure
resolver beside `moduleForPath`, using the same longest-match-on-whole-segments
rule that one already used — answers with the single entry, and the sidebar
renders from it. Mutation-proved: restoring the per-item prefix test turns the
shell spec red.

**A history row shows when the ticket STARTED as well as when it finished**,
with the turnaround under the finish ("25 min on the pass"), which is the
number a kitchen is actually judged on and could not be read off one stamp.

Started is the ticket's `createdAt` — when the round was sent and the ticket
reached the kitchen. It is deliberately NOT D113's "Start preparing" press:
that moment is a status change with no timestamp behind it
(`startTicket` writes `status` alone), so recording it means a migration AND
leaves every ticket already in the history blank, which is the opposite of what
a history screen is for. If the cook-time-versus-queue-time split turns out to
matter, it is a column, a decision and a backfill of its own.

**A row opens the whole order.** A kitchen ticket is one STATION's share of an
order, so the row — like the board card — shows only the items that station
cooked. `TicketOrderDialog` (D83) already answers "what did this table actually
order", across every station and round, with quantities, variants, modifiers
and special instructions; it moved out of `kitchen-board.tsx` into its own
module so the history opens the same dialog rather than growing a second answer
to the same question. The ticket number is a button — the keyboard and
screen-reader path — and the row click is a mouse convenience over the same
action, ignoring clicks that land on something interactive or that end a text
selection, which is the line the sales list already draws.

### D138 — promotions reach the restaurant bill (D52's deferral, lifted)

**Asked for by the PO, 2026-09-09**, after a promotion configured on a
food-service tenant took nothing off an order placed at the POS.

**Why it did nothing.** D52 deferred promotion pricing on a restaurant bill
with a reason that has since expired: "the promotions module exports only
`isPromotionActive`, an activity-window predicate. There is no promotion
*pricing* engine anywhere, so applying them is a feature to design, not a bug
to fix." D123 then built one —
`packages/shared/src/promotions/applier.ts` — and retail has charged
promotions through it since. What was left was wiring, and the absence of it
was invisible from the admin screens: a promotion could be created,
activated, badged on a menu card by the POS catalogue, and still never touch
a bill. `/pos` sends a TABLE_SERVICE tenant to `PosCounterWorkspace`, which
settles through the table-session and takeaway paths, and both wrote
`totalDiscount: 0` with no promotion pass at all.

**What now happens.** Both restaurant settlement paths and both of their
previews price promotions through the same applier retail uses:

- the dine-in running bill (`GET /table-sessions/:id/bill-preview`),
- the dine-in close (`POST /table-sessions/:id/close`),
- the counter/takeaway settle (`takeaway.settle`, which is what D110's
  counter payment calls),
- and the till's own cart preview in `PosCounterWorkspace`.

`RestaurantPromotionPricingService` owns the two reads (the tenant's live
promotions, which products are sold by measure) and delegates the decision to
the pure layer, so a bill and its preview cannot disagree.

**Channel is passed, never assumed.** `isPromotionActive` refuses a
channel-scoped promotion when the context names no channel, so a caller that
omitted it would silently price nothing — the same class of failure D56
found. Dine-in passes `DINE_IN`, takeaway passes `TAKEAWAY`: the values the
till's own catalogue read already sends, so the badge on a menu card and the
discount on the bill are decided by one predicate over one set of inputs.

**Where the money lands.** Line-level promotions reduce the goods, so the
service charge and the tax follow what the guest actually pays for food —
which is what `document-totals.ts` was written anticipating ("when promotions
reach the bill the charges follow what the customer actually pays, in one
place"). A D126 cart-level promotion comes off AFTER tax, the asymmetry
`sales.service` records as PO-confirmed; restaurant bills copy that rule
rather than inventing a second one for the same promotion. On the settled
`Sale`, line promotions are `totalDiscount` — which is what
`discountedSubtotal = subtotal - totalDiscount` has to mean for
`returns.calc` to reverse a refund correctly — and the cart-level one uses
its own `promotionOrder*` columns.

**No migration.** `SaleItem.promotionDiscountAmount` / `promotionId` /
`promotionNameSnapshot` and `Sale.promotionOrder*` have existed since D123
and D126. This slice writes columns that were already there.

**The invariant moved with it.** `assertProjectionMatchesSubtotal` compared
`Σ lineTotal` to the subtotal, which a promotion sitting between subtotal and
total would break. It now compares `Σ lineSubtotal` (unchanged for a bill
with no promotion) and checks the discount as its own identity beside it, so
a settled document whose lines and footer disagree still refuses to persist.

**Dine-in's cart card is deliberately NOT priced.** In dine-in mode the
running-bill card shows the round the waiter is adding, not the bill; the
bill is every round on the table and a bundle spans them. Pricing one round
there would show a figure the close then computes differently. The table's
bill sheet reads the server's preview, which prices the whole session.

**Still deferred.** Manual order-level discounts on a restaurant bill (D52's
second deferral) are untouched — they need the manager-approval flow retail
has, and are a separate piece of work.

**A known divergence, stated rather than hidden.** A counter line's manual
discount is client-side only — `RestaurantOrderItem` has no discount column,
which `pos-counter-workspace` has documented since the pilot. The cart
preview honours D123's rule (a manually discounted line is invisible to
promotions); the server, which never receives that discount, sees an
undiscounted line and may award a promotion on it. The preview and the bill
can therefore differ on a manually discounted line, in a flow where they
already differed because the manual discount itself never reaches the Sale.
The preview keeps the D123 rule rather than dropping it, so the day a
restaurant line discount is persisted the behaviour is already correct.

### D139 — a promotion's schedule is read on the tenant's clock, and its dates are whole days

Two defects found while tracing D138, both of which made a correctly
configured promotion quietly not fire.

**1. An end date lost its final day.** The editor's Start/End are
`type="date"`, so `'2026-09-30'` reaches the service and `new Date()` parses
it as `2026-09-30T00:00:00Z`. The evaluator compared it as an instant —
`now > endsOn` — so "ends 30 Sep" expired at 00:00 UTC ON the 30th. For a
Colombo tenant that is 05:30 local: the promotion was dead for all but the
first five and a half hours of the day it was meant to run. `startsOn` had
the mirror-image fault, holding a promotion back until 05:30 local on its
first day.

An operator setting a date means a whole day, inclusive, in their own zone.
Both bounds are now compared as `YYYY-MM-DD` calendar dates: the stored
value's UTC date (which IS the date typed, because a bare date parses as UTC
midnight) against today's date in the tenant's zone. Lexicographic order on
that format is chronological, so the comparison needs no date arithmetic.

*Not fixed by changing what is stored.* Writing `endsOn` as end-of-day would
need the tenant's zone at write time AND a backfill of every existing row,
and would leave two readings of the column in the codebase at once. Reading
the column as what it has always been — a calendar date — needs neither.

**2. The schedule was evaluated on the server's clock.** `isPromotionActive`
has accepted `tenantTimeZone` since D45 and no caller passed one, so every
day-of-week and time-of-day window was read in the host's zone. On a UTC
server an 11:00–15:00 lunch promotion for a Colombo tenant was live
16:30–20:30 their time — the offer ran through the evening and was off at
lunch. The optional parameter nobody passed is the failure shape: it type-
checked, it ran, and it was wrong.

Every call site now passes it, from `SettingsService.getSettings(tenantId)
.timezone` (guarded by `safeTimeZone`, and the same value every document
formatter already uses): the retail sale, the sellable/POS-catalogue read,
the restaurant pricing service (D138), and the `onlyCurrentlyValid` list.
The list route resolves it inside the service rather than taking it as an
argument, for the reason above — an optional parameter is a thing a caller
forgets.

**Mutation-proven.** Restoring the two instant-comparison lines fails exactly
three of the new date cases and leaves the rest green; the proof is recorded
inline in `promotions.evaluator.spec.ts` beside the cases it justifies (D30).

**Scope.** The evaluator's host-zone fallback stays for a caller with no
tenant context, and matches how `MenuAvailability` windows are still read.
No migration, no stored value changed.

### D140 — Buy X, Get Y is composed as a sentence, not a field grid

**Asked for by the PO, 2026-09-09**: "i feel now ui is confusing."

**What was confusing, precisely.** The editor asked for Buy quantity, Get
quantity and "Percentage off (100 = free)" in one row of boxes, then for
products in a flat list where every row carried a Role dropdown. Three
failures came out of that shape, and all three were silent:

- Every product landed as BUY (the picker's role heuristic), and a
  BUY_X_GET_Y with no GET item is skipped whole by the applier —
  `buyXGetYOutcome` returns null when `getIds` is empty. No badge, no
  discount, no error. The operator who reported this had exactly that.
- The picker deduped on product id alone, so one product could hold only one
  role — making "buy 2 shirts, get a third free", the commonest BOGO there
  is, impossible to express. The server has always accepted the pair
  (`@@unique([promotionId, productId, role])`) and the applier has a branch
  for it; only the editor blocked it.
- "100 = free" asked an operator to encode the ordinary case as a magic
  number. The one who reported this typed 7, and got a promotion that took
  7% off the "free" item.

**The shape now.** Two labelled sections — "Customer buys" and "Customer
gets" — which is what Shopify, Square, Lightspeed, Toast and Loyverse all
converge on. The section a product sits in IS its role, so there is no role
attribute to notice; each quantity sits beside the thing it counts; the
reward is Free (default) or a percentage; a "Same product as above" checkbox
covers the same-item case in one tap; and the offer is read back in one line
("Buy 2 × Shirt, get 1 × Tie free.") as it is composed.

Choosing in the Buy section REPLACES rather than appends, because the server
allows exactly one BUY item on this type — composing a second and being
refused at save time was reachable before. The save is blocked with a message
naming the missing half rather than passing an incomplete offer to the server
for an API-shaped rejection.

**Free means 100, decided once.** In the payload, not in the radio's handler.
The first cut wrote '100' into the field when the radio changed, which looked
equivalent and was not: a form left on its default Free had never run that
handler, so it sent `percentageOff: null` and the server refused it. Caught by
the new render spec before it shipped.

**No schema, API or data change.** The wire payload is byte-identical to what
the old form produced for the same offer; the other three promotion types keep
the shared product list unchanged.

### D141 — a money-off promotion states its scope; a threshold it cannot honour is unreachable

**Asked by the PO, 2026-09-09**, looking at the Amount-off form.

**The defect.** `minimumSpend` is read in exactly ONE place in the pricing
engine — `resolveOrderPromotion`, which only ever sees rules that
`isCartLevel` accepts, i.e. `FIXED_AMOUNT_DISCOUNT` with no items. The
product-scoped path (`applyFixedAmount`) never looks at it. The editor and the
server both accepted a threshold BESIDE a product list, so this saved happily:

    Amount off      100
    Minimum spend   10,000
    Products        Chicken Kottu

and took 100 off that dish on a 300-rupee basket, forever, with nothing
anywhere saying the 10,000 had been dropped. The figure was accepted,
validated, stored, and never consulted.

**The shape it came from.** D126 defines a cart-level money-off as one with no
products, which made the scope an emergent property of an empty list — a real
choice expressed as an ABSENCE, and explained only in a paragraph under the
fields. That is the same shape D140 removed from Buy X, Get Y, and it is what
allowed the impossible combination to be composed at all.

**Now.** "What it discounts" is an explicit choice — the whole cart, or
specific products — and the fields follow it. Whole cart shows Minimum spend
and no product list; Specific products shows the list and no threshold.
Switching clears what the other mode owned, because a leftover item would
silently make a cart-level rule product-scoped, and a leftover threshold would
persist a number that can never be read. The payload sends `minimumSpend` only
on a cart-level rule, so an older draft cannot smuggle one through either. The
offer is read back in one line, as on the BOGO form.

Saving a product-scoped rule with no products is now refused, naming the
alternative ("or switch to the whole cart"). It used to save — as a cart-level
promotion, which is not what the operator had selected.

**No schema, API or data change.** Cart-level still means "no items" on the
wire. Existing rows reopen in the right mode, read from that same shape.

**Not changed: the engine.** Whether a product-scoped money-off SHOULD honour
a threshold is a product question, not a bug — the editor now matches what the
engine does rather than promising what it does not.

### D161 — a tenant defines its own business details, and D135's packs are withdrawn

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-09. **Retail only.** No schema change,
no migration. **Supersedes D135**, which is withdrawn unbuilt.

### The problem, restated from D135

`ProductAttributesService.schemaForTenant` resolved **one schema per business
type**. The `RETAIL` descriptor declares the clothing list — `material`, `fit`,
`careInstructions`, `gender`, `season` — and clothing and grocery are both
`RETAIL` because **Q12 resolved: do not split `RETAIL`**. So a grocer was asked
for **Fit** and **Season**, and `validateAttributes` refused `allergens` as an
unknown key. Not a missing feature; an actively wrong one.

### Why D135's answer is withdrawn

D135 proposed that a **domain** declare named packs (`attributePacks`) and a
tenant select one, stored in a new nullable column
`TenantBusinessProfile.cataloguePack`.

It is withdrawn for three reasons, none of which were visible at planning time:

1. **It does not actually answer the question.** A pack is a list somebody else
   chose. The grocer whose problem opened D135 does not want *our* grocery pack;
   they want `expiryDate` because they sell dairy. D135 itself conceded this —
   "What this does NOT decide: the grocery pack's field list… that draft needs a
   real grocer before it is committed to". A pack ships the same wrongness with
   a different list, and then needs a code change and a deploy every time a
   tenant asks for one more field.
2. **It costs a migration to store a choice we already have somewhere to put.**
   `TenantSettings.data.catalogue` is a JSON blob that has held tenant catalogue
   configuration since 5.8. A tenant's own field list is exactly that shape.
3. **It is strictly less powerful for strictly more schema.** A tenant-authored
   list *contains* packs: "the grocery pack" is a list a tenant can type once.

### The decision

**A tenant whose domain allows it defines its own business details.** The list
lives in `TenantSettings.data.catalogue.businessDetails` and replaces the
domain's declared `attributeSchema` for that tenant.

```ts
// capabilities.ts — optional, for the same reason `measuredGoods` is.
readonly catalogue: {
  readonly configurableBusinessDetails?: boolean;
};
```

`true` on the **retail descriptor** only. It could not live in
`RETAIL_CAPABILITIES`, because that constant **is** the hardware template
(D134e's finding, unchanged); it sits on the one line where the two domains
differ. Optional rather than required, deliberately: required would mean editing
the hardware, food-service, hotel and general templates to declare that nothing
about them changes.

**Three states, all distinct:**

| Stored value | Meaning | Wizard |
|---|---|---|
| **absent** | the tenant has said nothing | the domain's list — every tenant today |
| **`[]`** | "we track none" | the step disappears (`visibleSteps`) |
| **a list** | the tenant's own fields | that list |

Absence is the safety property, and it is the same one D135 wanted from a
nullable column without needing the column: every existing tenant — clothing,
hardware, restaurant, every domain — resolves exactly as it does today with no
backfill. Only a tenant that opens the tab and saves sees anything different.

### One resolver, not two

`BusinessDetailsService.schemaFor` is the single resolver;
`ProductAttributesService.schemaForTenant` delegates to it. The wizard, `GET
/products/attribute-schema` and server-side attribute validation therefore
cannot disagree about what a tenant's fields are — which is the property D64
bought by declaring one list, and the one a second resolver would have spent.

**A stored list is ignored where the capability is off**, rather than obeyed. A
workspace that changes business type must not keep enforcing the previous
type's fields. The list is not deleted — changing back restores it.

### Field types

`text`, `enum` (dropdown) and the new `date` — the three the PO asked for. The
existing `integer`, `number` and `boolean` remain valid in the schema and are
still rendered and validated; they are simply not offered in the Settings
editor, because no tenant asked to author one and every type offered is a type
that must keep working forever.

`date` is a **calendar date**, validated as one:

```ts
export function isCalendarDate(raw: string): boolean {
  if (!/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/.test(raw)) return false;
  const d = new Date(`${raw}T00:00:00Z`);
  return !Number.isNaN(d.getTime()) && d.toISOString().slice(0, 10) === raw;
}
```

The round-trip comparison is the point: a pattern alone accepts `2026-02-31`,
and a browser date input on some platforms will hand exactly that over.

### D135's two traps, both answered

**1. Switching strands stored attributes.** D135 required the build to "either
refuse the switch once products carry attributes, or make it an explicit
operation with a warning naming the count". **The PO chose refuse.** Removing a
field, removing a dropdown option, or changing a field's type is refused with
409 and the count while any product records it:

> `3 product(s) still record "Material". Clear it on those products before removing the field.`

This matches `AttributeLibraryService.remove`, which refuses a definition a
variant points at. Nothing is cascaded and nothing is silently rewritten. The
guard fired for real on live data during development — the `Umbalakada` product
holds `careInstructions: "supiriyak"`.

**2. A field is a commitment.** The `key` is derived from the label once, when
the field is first saved, and then frozen. The Settings screen offers a rename
of the **label** and never of the key, because renaming a key orphans every
value already stored under it. D64 says this of the schema; it is equally true
of a tenant's own list.

### Why the API is not module-gated

`/products/business-details` is permission-gated (`product:read` / `product:manage`)
and **not** module-gated. Whether a workspace may define its own catalogue fields
is a **capability of its business type**, which the service reads and refuses on
(D56). A module gate would be a second, weaker answer to the same question —
right today, wrong the moment a second domain opts in. Hiding the Settings tab
is usability; the server remains the authority and refuses a workspace whose
domain does not offer it, whatever the browser draws.

### What this does NOT decide

**Whether any other domain gets it.** Retail alone, because retail alone has the
clothing-vs-grocery problem that opened D135. Hardware, food-service, hotel and
general are untouched, and a tripwire over the real registry asserts it.

**A grocery preset.** Deliberately not shipped. A tenant types its own fields;
that is the whole point of withdrawing packs. If a preset is ever wanted it is a
seed, not a schema.

---

### D162 — the Inventory tab bar is per workspace: Attributes and Barcodes are not for everyone

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-09. No schema change, no migration,
no route removed, no API gate changed.

### The problem

`InventoryTabs` rendered a module-level array unconditionally, so every
workspace got the same seven tabs:

```
Products | Categories | Promotions | Attributes | Barcodes | Stock | Purchases
```

Two of those are not for every business:

- **Attributes** (D125's reusable variation-attribute library) pays for itself
  in a catalogue with many variants of the same few scales — Size, Colour, Fit.
  A hardware counter types a variation on the rare product that needs one and
  keeps no library of them. A kitchen's variants are not scales at all.
- **Barcodes** (Phase 5's in-store EAN-13 allocation, audit and shelf labels) is
  a stocked-goods activity. A kitchen does not barcode a portion of rice.

Both were doors to features those workspaces never walk through.

### The decision

| | Attributes | Barcodes |
|---|---|---|
| **RETAIL** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **HARDWARE** | ❌ | ✅ |
| **RESTAURANT / CAFE / BAKERY / HOTEL** | ❌ | ❌ |
| **GENERAL** | ✅ | ✅ |

Two optional capabilities, `catalogue.attributeLibrary` and
`catalogue.internalBarcodes`, resolved once by `resolveCatalogueTabs` in
`product-presentation.ts`. The tab bar reads flags and filters; it names no
capability and no business type.

### Why the two flags cannot live in the same place

`RETAIL_CAPABILITIES` **is** the hardware template — hardware reads it verbatim
and retail spreads it (D134e's finding, unchanged). Hardware and retail need
DIFFERENT answers for Attributes and the SAME answer for Barcodes, so:

- `internalBarcodes: true` on **`RETAIL_CAPABILITIES`** → hardware and retail
  both keep it, which is the point.
- `attributeLibrary: true` on the **retail descriptor's** spread → retail only,
  the same pattern `measuredGoods` and `configurableBusinessDetails` use.

`FOOD_SERVICE_CAPABILITIES` is **not edited at all**. Absent means false, so
restaurant, cafe, bakery and hotel lose both without the food-service template
being touched — which is the desired blast radius on a branch other teams merge
into.

### Why `GENERAL` keeps both

Nothing asked to change it. It showed both tabs before this decision, and
hiding two working screens from a template nobody was discussing would be a
regression smuggled in beside a requested change. Declared explicitly on
`GENERAL_CAPABILITIES` rather than inherited, because absent means false and
silence would have removed them.

### Why `HOTEL` loses both

It shares `FOOD_SERVICE_CAPABILITIES`. Giving it a different answer would mean
forking the hotel descriptor to contradict the capability set it exists to
reuse. HOTEL is the business type the seven hand-written predicates D56 replaced
had all independently forgotten; it is named in the tests for that reason.

### Why not `ProductBusinessKind`

The coarse `RESTAURANT` / `RETAIL` split already exists and is the obvious
shortcut. It cannot express this: its `RETAIL` bucket covers hardware, general
trade and retail together, and hardware must differ from retail on one flag and
match it on the other. A capability per surface is the only thing that says it.

### Hiding is usability — the routes and the API are unchanged

`/products/attributes` and `/products/barcodes` still render for anyone who
types the URL and holds the permission, and `/attribute-library` stays **shared
core**: D125 gated it on permission rather than business type deliberately, so
any workspace that does want a library may use one. This decision changes what
the bar draws and nothing else. CLAUDE.md: *frontend hiding is usability only;
the server remains the authority.*

That is also why nothing here is a security boundary, and why the change needed
no server work at all.

### Tests

`product-presentation.test.ts` asserts the exact map over the real registry —
walked from `BUSINESS_TYPE_VALUES`, so a new business type fails by name — plus
that the two flags disagree for hardware, which is the case a single shared flag
could not express.

`inventory-tabs.render.test.tsx` renders the real component and reads the tabs
off the screen, asserting the WHOLE sequence rather than the absence of one
label: "restaurant has no Barcodes tab" would hold for a bar that rendered
nothing, and rendering nothing is a live possibility when both capabilities are
optional.

Mutation-proven: removing the filter fails 5; swapping which flag gates which
tab fails 2 — and only the hardware case tells the swap apart, which is stated
in the spec.

### D163 — retail's bill prints on a roll; its quotations stay on the letterhead

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-09. Frontend only. No schema change,
no migration, no route removed, no server behaviour changed.

### What was asked

Retail needs only a thermal bill. The A4 bill goes, and Settings' Layout and
Preview should be about the bill.

### Why it was not a one-line change

The Settings screen routed on `documents.proformaBill`, which means **"a
pre-payment bill is issued separately from the receipt"** — the bill a waiter
brings to a table before anyone has paid. It had been standing in for "prints on
80mm paper" since D96, and the two happened to coincide because food service was
the only thermal domain.

Retail breaks the coincidence twice over:

1. **A shop issues no proforma.** Flipping `proformaBill` to `true` for retail
   would assert something false about it in the domain registry — the proxy
   abuse D56 exists to prevent — and any future feature reading that capability
   for what it actually means would then be wrong about retail.
2. **Retail prints BOTH.** It rings up on a roll and quotes on a letterhead.
   `proformaBill` is one boolean between two surfaces, so it cannot say that at
   all: routing retail to the food-service surface strips the signature block,
   stamp, accent colour, logo placement, page size and column toggles — every
   one of which belongs to the **quotation** that retail still issues.

The second point is the one that decided the shape. Retail is not "A4 with a
thermal option" or "thermal with extras"; it genuinely prints two documents.

### The decision

**Two capabilities, replacing the proxy, and a third surface.**

```ts
readonly documents: {
  readonly proformaBill: boolean;   // unchanged, and no longer a discriminator
  readonly splitByItem: boolean;
  readonly thermalBill?: boolean;   // the BILL prints on an 80mm roll
  readonly a4Documents?: boolean;   // the tenant issues A4 documents on a letterhead
};
```

| | thermalBill | a4Documents | surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HARDWARE** | — | ✅ | `A4_DOCUMENTS` *(unchanged)* |
| **GENERAL** | — | ✅ | `A4_DOCUMENTS` *(unchanged)* |
| **RESTAURANT / CAFE / BAKERY / HOTEL** | ✅ | — | `THERMAL_BILL` *(unchanged)* |
| **RETAIL** | ✅ | ✅ | `THERMAL_BILL_AND_A4_DOCUMENTS` **(new)** |

`thermalBill` sits on the **retail descriptor's** spread, not in
`RETAIL_CAPABILITIES` — that constant **is** the hardware template (D134e), and
hardware still prints an A4 bill. `a4Documents` sits **on** the shared constant,
because hardware and retail both quote. `FOOD_SERVICE_CAPABILITIES` gains
`thermalBill: true`, which states directly what `proformaBill` had been standing
in for and changes no behaviour: food service resolved to the thermal surface
before this line and resolves to it after.

`proformaBill` is kept. A restaurant really does issue a pre-payment bill, and a
future feature may act on that. What it must never be again is a stand-in for
paper — a contract test now asserts it is read by **nothing**.

### What retail gets

| | |
|---|---|
| **Sale page** | "Print A4 bill" is gone. "Thermal receipt" stays — that IS the document |
| **POS payment** | the "Print A4 bill after payment" toggle is gone, and the auto-print is gated |
| **Branding** | unchanged — logo, accent, signature, stamp, all still the quotation's |
| **Layout** | the A4 page controls **plus** the read-only summary of what the slip prints |
| **Preview** | the bill preview and roll calibration **plus** the A4 chooser, minus "Invoice / Bill" |

### The one that would have been missed

The POS payment screen opened the A4 print window on **every completed sale** —
`printAfter` defaults to `true`. Removing the button from the sale page alone
would have hidden the door while the till kept walking through it. The auto-open
is now gated on the same flag the button is, and the flag is checked at the call
site as well as on the control: the toggle's state survives a profile that
resolves late, so a hidden switch left `true` would still have fired.

### Two structural changes this forced

**`LayoutTab` stopped being either/or.** It early-returned the bill summary,
because until now every workspace that printed a bill printed *only* a bill.
Each half is now guarded by its own flag, so all three surfaces read out of the
same code: summary only, controls only, or both.

**The Preview chooser drops "Invoice / Bill" where there is no A4 sale
document.** Previewing a document the operator cannot print is the dead control
D96 was written to remove. Quotation, return and exchange remain.

### A latent test defect this uncovered

The D96 contract test asserted the resolver "names the capability it routes on"
against **raw** source, so a capability named only in a doc comment satisfied it
— the exact vacuity D30 describes. It was live: after the discriminator moved,
the assertion still passed on a sentence explaining what the code no longer did.
It now runs on stripped source and pairs the positive with a negative.

### Hiding is usability

`/print/sales/[saleId]` stays ungated and a typed URL still renders an A4 bill,
exactly as D96 recorded. The server is unchanged; no API gained or lost a gate.
This decides what the screens offer.

### Scope deliberately not taken

The **A4 note** on the returns screen is offered to every workspace and is gated
by nothing at all — including food service, which has had no letterhead controls
since D96. That is a pre-existing inconsistency, older than this decision and
not what was asked for; it is recorded here rather than fixed in passing.

### D164 — a preview shows the operator's own trade, and their own name

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-09. Preview/sample data only. No
schema change, no migration, no change to any real document.

### Two defects, both reported from a screenshot

A retail owner opened `Settings → Preview` and saw:

1. a **thermal bill full of restaurant food** — Chicken Fried Rice, Grilled
   Seer, Vegetable Kottu, Black Coffee — with a **service charge** row and a
   **table number**;
2. an **A4 quotation headed "Hardware POS"**, on a workspace whose business
   name has never been set.

Neither is cosmetic. The preview is the one place an operator checks whether
their logo is too wide, whether the note reads right, whether a long product
name wraps — and a bill full of somebody else's trade answers none of it. It
also reads as a bug, because it is one.

### Why the bill was full of food

`buildSampleBill` held one hard-coded catalogue, and it was a menu. That was
correct while food service was the only domain that previewed a thermal bill.
**D163 gave retail a thermal bill the day before**, and this list stopped being
read only by restaurants.

The service charge and the table are the same defect wearing different clothes:
a shop charges no service charge, so previewing that row shows a line its bill
will never print, and a table number on a counter sale is meaningless.

**The fix.** Two catalogues, selected by a new `billSampleKind` on the
presentation — `'FOOD_SERVICE' | 'RETAIL' | null`, resolved where every other
document decision is. The Settings component reads a flag and names no business
type, which is what the D96 contract test requires of it.

The retail basket is **groceries and clothing together**, because `RETAIL` is
one business type covering both (Q12 resolved not to split it) and a sample
showing one would look wrong to half the workspaces that see it. It carries a
size variant and a fractional weight deliberately: those are the two rows a
retail bill has that a restaurant's does not.

### Why the quotation said "Hardware POS"

`buildSampleDocument` fell back to the literal `'Hardware POS'` whenever
`documents.companyName` was unset — which is **every workspace that has not been
through Settings yet**. Checked against the database before believing it: every
retail tenant has `companyName: null`, so what the owner saw was the fallback,
not their data. The Settings field's placeholder was the same literal, which is
why it looked configured.

**The fix.** The preview now uses the **tenant's own registered name**. Swapping
one hard-coded vertical for another only moves the problem to whoever is not
that vertical; the tenant's name is the one answer right for all of them, and it
is what the operator would have typed anyway. Where even that is missing the
fallback is `'Your Business'` — neutral, because a missing name is not a reason
to claim a trade.

`previewHtml` became **async** to do it. That adds exactly one indexed lookup to
a Settings-screen render, and its spec's stub comment — which said the preview
path "never touches the database" — was corrected rather than left to mislead
the next reader.

### What was deliberately NOT changed

**The A4 sample line items are still hardware** — Portland Cement, TMT Steel
Bar, PVC Pipe. The same defect class as the bill's menu, and visible on a retail
quotation preview today.

It is left alone because fixing it properly means making `SAMPLE_ITEMS`
domain-aware, and the only home for a per-vertical catalogue that does not
re-introduce a business-type if-chain is the domain registry itself (D56) —
which would put preview illustration into the shared descriptors that every app
reads. That is a larger decision than a sample list deserves, and it was not
what was asked for. Recorded here so it is chosen deliberately rather than
found again.

It affects hardware, general and retail; food service never renders the A4
preview at all (D96).

---

### D165 — a vertical declares the goods its document previews show

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-10. Preview/sample data only. No schema
change, no migration, no change to any real document. **Completes D164**, which
fixed the thermal bill's sample and deliberately left this one.

### The problem D164 recorded and did not fix

`SAMPLE_ITEMS` in `documents.service.ts` was a hardware catalogue — Portland
Cement, TMT Steel Bar, PVC Pipe — and it was the **only** sample catalogue in the
product. Every workspace's A4 preview used it, so a clothing shop opening
`Settings → Preview` saw a quotation for building materials on its own
letterhead.

This is a **sales surface**, not an internal screen. A shop owner evaluating the
product opens Preview to see what their quotation will look like; seeing another
trade's goods is the moment they decide whether the product was built for them.
That is why it was worth returning to.

### Why D164 stopped, and what changed

D164 fixed the thermal bill's sample cheaply because that document is rendered
**client-side**, where a presentation resolver was already in the call path. The
A4 document is rendered **server-side**, where none exists — so the server would
have to choose a catalogue by business type, and `businessType === 'RETAIL'` in a
service is exactly the if-chain **D56** confines to the domain registry.

The way out is to stop treating it as a branch. **A vertical declares its own
sample goods, and the server reads the registry.** There is no comparison to
place anywhere, so there is nothing for D56 to forbid.

### The decision

```ts
readonly catalogue: {
  readonly attributeSchema: readonly AttributeField[];
  readonly sampleItems?: readonly SampleCatalogueItem[];   // D165
};
```

| Domain | Declares | Preview shows |
|---|---|---|
| **HARDWARE** | its original eight lines | **unchanged** |
| **RETAIL** | clothing and groceries | its own trade |
| **GENERAL** | nothing | neutral filler |
| **RESTAURANT / CAFE / BAKERY / HOTEL** | nothing | neutral filler — and they never render the A4 preview at all (D96/D163) |

### Why the field is optional, when its own block says required

`DomainDescriptor.catalogue` documents itself as required *"so a new descriptor
must SAY 'no attributes' rather than get it by omission; the silent-fallback
failure mode is the one this whole module exists to end."*

That rule is right, and this is the exception that proves its reasoning rather
than an erosion of it. The failure mode it guards against is a vertical silently
inheriting **another vertical's** answer — precisely the defect D165 fixes.

**Omission here falls back to a NEUTRAL list**, not to hardware's. `Standard Item
1`, `Standard Item 2`, and so on: dull, but it claims no trade. Silence therefore
cannot hand anyone somebody else's goods, and the hazard the required rule exists
for cannot occur.

Making it required would instead have forced an edit to the **food-service and
general descriptors** — templates another team owns — to declare something about
a screen food service never even renders. The isolation rule that has governed
this whole engagement says do not touch them, and a neutral fallback is what lets
us honour it.

### Hardware is provably unchanged, not promised unchanged

Its eight lines were **lifted out and re-inserted character for character** — the
patch that moved them read them from the source rather than retyping them, which
is what makes byte-fidelity a fact rather than an intention.

A test then renders hardware's preview at eight lines with the SKU column on and
pins **every name, two SKUs and a price**. Names alone would pass for a list that
kept the labels and lost the rows.

Three mutations were run by hand, and each was caught:

| Mutation | Caught by |
|---|---|
| retail declares nothing → falls back to neutral | 4 tests |
| **hardware declares nothing** → silently regresses to filler | 4 tests |
| the fallback becomes hardware's list → rebuilds the defect one level down | 3 tests |

The second is the one that matters. Hardware belongs to another team, and a
relocation that quietly dropped its list would be invisible to anyone reading the
retail work.

### Where the business type is read

`DocumentsService` injects `BusinessProfileService` and calls `domainFor(...)`.
**D28** forbids `ProductsService`, `SalesService` and `ReturnsService` from
injecting it, so that a business rule is never decided by a profile branch inside
a service. This service decides nothing about a transaction — it chooses which
illustrative goods a preview draws — and it reads the registry rather than
branching on the type. `DocumentsModule` imports `PlatformModule` explicitly even
though that module is `@Global()`, following the precedent set in
`providers.module.ts`: global only means "no re-import once it is in the graph",
and something still has to put it there for a smaller graph to compile.

### One deliberate behaviour change beyond retail

**GENERAL's A4 preview moves from hardware goods to neutral filler.** It is the
only workspace besides hardware and retail that renders this preview, and it
declares no sample items.

This is the intended consequence of choosing a neutral fallback over a hardware
one, and it is an improvement — general trade is not a hardware store — but it is
a change to a template we did not otherwise touch, and it is recorded here rather
than left to be discovered.

### What this does NOT decide

**Whether a preview should show the tenant's own real products** instead of any
declared list. That was the alternative considered and set aside: it needs a
query and an empty-catalogue fallback, and it would have changed hardware's
preview — an outcome the isolation rule made unattractive even though the result
would arguably be better. It stays available as a later refinement.

**The thermal bill keeps its own separate sample** (D164), selected by a
presentation flag rather than by the descriptor. The two mechanisms now differ,
which is worth revisiting if a third document surface ever appears; the goods
themselves were deliberately kept in step, so a retail shop's two documents
illustrate the same shop.

### D166 — a same-product offer says how close it is, and never blocks the sale

> **SUPERSEDED by [D171](#d160) on 2026-09-10, the same day.** The
> arithmetic below still stands and is still in the code; the POLICY does
> not. The PO reversed it: every unfinished `BUY_X_GET_Y` now blocks payment,
> same-product ones included. Read D171 before acting on anything here.

**Status:** superseded. Was accepted and built 2026-09-10. Frontend and
shared only. No schema change, no migration, no server behaviour changed.

### What was reported

A *"buy 5 ties, get 1 free"* promotion appeared to do nothing: five ties in the
basket produced no badge, no discount and no notice. The expectation was parity
with the shirt offer, which names itself and refuses payment until the reward is
in the basket.

### What was actually happening

Nothing was broken. Checked against the real promotions before changing
anything:

| Promotion | Buy | Get | Same product? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Buy 2 Get 1 Free | Shirt | **Tie** | no |
| Tie | Tie | **Tie** | **yes** |

A same-product BOGO is **six for the price of five** — the free unit is drawn
from the same pile that earns it. Verified against the applier directly:

```
5 ties  -> discount Rs 0
6 ties  -> discount Rs 500   ✓
12 ties -> discount Rs 1000  ✓
```

So the offer worked; it takes six. And `rewardEntitlements` suppresses the
same-product case on purpose:

> *A same-product BOGO draws its reward from the pool it counts, so the customer
> is always already holding it. Reporting an entitlement would ask the till to
> add a unit that earns nothing and gets charged for.*

### Why parity with the shirt offer was rejected

`outstandingRewards` gates `canPay` (4.14), and it is right to. With the shirt
offer the customer has **earned a tie they are not holding**; completing the sale
would pocket a promised freebie, so the till must refuse.

With the tie offer at five, **nothing is owed**. Five ties at full price is a
legitimate sale, and refusing payment would mean a till that will not let a
customer buy what they asked for because a *larger* purchase would have been a
better deal. That is hostility dressed as helpfulness, and the PO agreed.

### The real gap, and the decision

At five ties the till said **nothing at all** — the cashier could not see that
one more tie costs the customer nothing.

**`rewardUpsells` reports how close a same-product offer is. It is an OFFER, not
a debt, and it must never reach `canPay`.**

```
qty  prompt                discount  blocks payment
 4   —                     Rs 0      no
 5   add 1, one is free    Rs 0      no
 6   —                     Rs 500    no
11   add 1, one is free    Rs 500    no
12   —                     Rs 1000   no
```

### Why a separate function, not a flag on the existing one

They answer different questions and carry different authority:

- `outstandingRewards` is a **debt** — earned, unheld, and it closes the payment
  gate.
- `rewardUpsells` is an **offer** — unearned, declinable, and it must not.

Returning both from one function would invite a caller to feed the lot into
`canPay` and refuse the five-tie sale — the exact behaviour this was chosen
over. Two types, so the compiler keeps them apart. A mutation that wires the
upsell into `canPay` fails the render spec.

### When it fires

Only once the BUY threshold **within the current group** is met, so a basket of
one tie is not nagged about an offer four units away. It reads the remainder
rather than the total, which is what makes it right on a repeat: at eleven the
customer holds one complete group and five spare, so they are one away from a
*second* free tie.

Measured lines (D134a) and manually discounted lines (D123) earn no prompt —
both are invisible to the applier, and promising a free unit the applier will
refuse to give is the badge-and-charge disagreement that 2.12 and 3.10 both
were.

Different-product rewards are not reported here. Those reach the cashier through
`outstandingRewards` the moment they are earned, and prompting beforehand would
be a second, weaker voice on one offer.

### On the screen

Muted, in the surface colour rather than the primary the debt notice uses, and
worded as what the customer **gets** rather than what the till **requires**. It
is suppressed entirely while a real debt is outstanding, so the cashier reads
one instruction at a time and the blocking one wins.

### Also in this change

The promotion editor's name placeholder read **"e.g. Lunch Bundle"** — a
restaurant example in a shared editor, so a clothing shop naming a promotion was
prompted with a lunch deal. Now "e.g. Weekend Offer". Same class as the `"e.g.
Milk 200ml"` placeholder that `2.13` removed from the product wizard, in the one
screen that had kept it.

---

### D167 — an empty list is not an answer until somebody has answered

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-10. Frontend only. No schema change,
no migration, no API change.

### What was reported

The product detail page for a 25-variant product showed:

> Variants: **Single-variant product** · Total stock: **550** · Selling price:
> **Rs. 0.00** · SKU: **—**

### What was actually wrong

Traced end to end against the live API before changing anything, because the
symptom looks like a data fault and is not one:

| Layer | Answer |
|---|---|
| database | `hasVariants=true`, **25 variants**, 2 dimensions |
| `GET /products/:id` | `hasVariants: true` ✅ |
| `GET /products/:id/variants` | **25 rows** ✅ |
| `api.ts` envelope unwrap | correct ✅ |
| `toVariant` mapping | defensive, cannot throw ✅ |

Every layer was right. The defect was one expression:

```ts
const hasVariants = product.hasVariants && variants.length > 0;
```

`variants` arrives in a **second** fetch that deliberately does not gate the
page's loading state, so it is `[]` on first paint. That `&&` threw away the
authoritative half — `product.hasVariants`, which arrives *with* the product —
and read the not-yet-fetched empty array as fact.

So the page announced a shape it had not been told, alongside the parent's
`unitPrice` and `quantityOnHand`: precisely the fields **D44** exists to say are
**not read** once `hasVariants` is true. Rs 0.00 is what every product created
since D44 carries there.

### Why it was easy to miss, and worse than it looked

It corrects itself when the fetch lands, so on a fast connection it is a
flicker. Two things make it more than cosmetic:

1. On a slow connection it **lingers**, and the number it shows is wrong rather
   than absent.
2. The fetch caught its own error and returned `[]`, so a **failed** request was
   indistinguishable from a genuine answer and **never corrected**. The operator
   read a confident, wrong description of their product with nothing on screen
   suggesting anything had gone wrong.

### The decision

**Distinguish "no variants" from "not asked yet" from "asked and failed."**

```ts
const variantsKnown     = variantsState === 'ready';
const hasVariants       = product.hasVariants && (!variantsKnown || variants.length > 0);
const variantFactsKnown = !product.hasVariants || variantsKnown;
```

`product.hasVariants` is authoritative for the SHAPE and arrives immediately.
Only the **count** and the **price range** need the list, and only those wait.

| State | Variants | Selling price |
|---|---|---|
| loading | `Loading…` | `Loading…` |
| ready | `25 active` | range across active variants |
| error | `Could not be loaded` + how to recover | — |
| single-variant | `Single-variant product`, **immediately** | the parent's price, correct here |

The last row is the one that keeps the fix honest: a product the payload already
says is single-variant must not wait on a list it has no reason to care about,
or the change would have traded a wrong answer for a slow one on every simple
product in the catalogue.

The `&& variants.length > 0` guard is **kept** for the case it was written for —
a product flagged `hasVariants` with no rows, which is a real state — but it now
applies only once the list is genuinely known.

### Failures are reported, not flattened

Branches and variations still fall back to `[]` on failure: a slow branches
endpoint must not hide the page, and neither changes what the product IS. The
variant list does, so its outcome is tracked. `[]` from a failure and `[]` from
a product with no variants are different facts and must not render alike.

### A vacuous test, caught during the work

The first version of "does not show the parent's legacy price while loading"
asserted `Rs 0.00` was absent — against a fixture whose price is **220**. It
could not have failed whatever the component did. Rebuilt around the real shape
(`unitPrice: 0`, what every post-D44 variant product carries), after which the
mutation fails two tests instead of one. Recorded because it is the exact
failure mode D30 names, found in new work rather than old.

### Mutation proof

Restoring the old derive reproduces the reported screenshot precisely and fails
two cases: the shape claim and the price.

### D168 — two previews, one at a time

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-10. Frontend only. No schema change,
no migration, no API change. Retail only.

### What was reported

> "cant we use a switch button or something display thermal-preview or
> A4-preview without adding one below other"

### The problem D163 left behind

D163 gave retail both previews, because retail prints both, and stacked them:
bill on top, quotation underneath. That was the right content in the wrong
arrangement. A thermal bill is a **metre of paper** rendered at full length, so
reaching the quotation meant scrolling past an entire receipt, and neither
document could be seen whole. The taller the workspace's bill — more line
items, a longer footer — the worse it got.

### The decision

**One preview on screen at a time, chosen by a segmented control.** The bill is
the default: it goes to a customer on every single sale, where a quotation is
occasional.

Three sub-decisions, each of which a mutation proof pins to one test:

**1. A tablist, not a switch or a pair of buttons.**
A switch means on/off. This is a choice between two named documents, and
flipping it swaps a panel of content — which is what `role="tablist"` means.
Built on the existing `Tabs` primitive (D44), so it inherits roving arrow-key
focus, `aria-selected`, and the tabpanel wiring rather than reimplementing
them. The LOOK is borrowed class for class from `ThemeToggle`, the segmented
control this app already uses, so a second visual idiom was not invented.

**2. The hidden panel keeps its DOM.**
`TabsContent` hides rather than unmounts. `PreviewTab` holds the chosen
document type in its own state, so a `{cond ? <A/> : <B/>}` implementation
would reset an operator comparing a return slip against the bill to
"Quotation" on every flip.

**3. The choice lives on the page, not inside the Preview panel.**
The loop an operator actually works in is: change the logo, look at the bill,
change it again. The main tab bar is a ternary and discards whatever the panel
held, so state kept there would land them back on the bill every time they came
back from Branding.

### What did not change

Hardware and restaurant preview one document each and get **no** toggle: a
segmented control with one segment is a dead control, which is what D96 exists
to remove. Both are asserted directly, each paired with the preview it *does*
have so "no tabs" cannot pass because the page rendered nothing.

D163's and D164's eleven existing assertions are untouched (D16) and still
green. They query by title and label, which find hidden nodes, so they state
what retail previews — not where on the page it sits. That is the right
division: this decision changed the arrangement, not the content.

### Mutation proof

Three mutations, each failing exactly — and only — the case that carries
its decision:

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| both panels visible at once (the stacked layout) | the 3 visibility cases |
| the hidden panel is unmounted rather than hidden | *only* "keeps its document across a flip" |
| the main tab bar resets the choice | *only* "survives a trip to another tab and back" |

"Not stacked" is a claim about what is **visible**, and the hidden panel is
still in the DOM on purpose. `getByText`/`getByTitle` cannot state it — they
find hidden nodes and would pass just as happily against the old layout. The
assertions read through `screen.getByRole('tabpanel')`, which omits `hidden`
subtrees and throws on more than one match: it therefore asserts EXACTLY ONE
visible panel, and fails against the stacked layout for the right reason.

### D169 — the Overview shows what the product IS

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-10. Frontend only. No schema change,
no migration, **no API change** — every field below already crossed the wire.

### What was reported

> "another issues with product details view because its not rendering the data
> and some data are missing from it like category, brand, if have business
> details it needed to show too, variations etc are missing too"

### Where the data already was

Traced before writing anything, because "missing data" usually means a missing
endpoint and here it meant nothing of the kind:

| Field | Where it was | What was missing |
|---|---|---|
| `categoryId` / `subcategoryId` | on the product payload | only the NAMES |
| `brandId` | **on the wire already** | the TypeScript declaration |
| `attributes` (D64) | on the product payload | the labels, and a card |
| variation dimensions | **already fetched** | anything that rendered them |

`brandId` is the interesting one. `GET /products/:id` runs
`findFirst({ where })` with no `select`, so the whole Prisma row is returned;
`toManaged` spreads `...p`, so the field survived the mapper. It was simply
never written down in `ManagedProduct`, and TypeScript will not let you read a
field a type does not declare. Confirmed against a live response before the
declaration was added, rather than inferred from the query. This is the same
class of gap D125 recorded for `attributeOptionId`: *"The server has always
returned it; it was simply not typed here."*

The variation dimensions are the other kind of gap: fetched on every page load
since D44 and passed to exactly one consumer — the variant edit dialog. An
operator could see that a product had 25 variants and not what it varied ON.

### The decision

**Resolve the names client-side; change no payload.**

Three catalogue requests, each issued **only when the product carries the id it
would resolve**: an uncategorised product asks for no categories, and a product
with no brand asks for no brands. Variations cost nothing new.

### Every answer has three states, not two

The resolvers live in `catalogue-labels.ts` as pure functions because the rule
they encode is D167's, one card over:

> the ID is authoritative and arrives WITH the product;
> only the NAME needs the catalogue, so only the name waits.

| | Category |
|---|---|
| no `categoryId` | `—` **at once** — never waits on a list it does not need |
| id, catalogue in flight | `Loading…` — **not** `—`, which would claim it has none |
| id, catalogue failed | `Could not be loaded` |
| id not in the catalogue | `No longer in the catalogue` — it HAS one; we cannot name it |

That first row is the guard against overcorrecting D167 into a slow answer
where an instant true one exists. The fourth is a real state: brands are
archived, categories are deleted while a page is open.

### Consequences that were followed through

**The variations fetch now reports its outcome.** D167 deliberately left this
one flattened to `[]` on failure and said why: *"neither changes what the
product IS"* — true while nothing displayed it. A Variations card makes `[]`
from a failure and `[]` from a product with no dimensions two different facts,
so `variationsState` now exists alongside `variantsState`.

**Brand renders only where there is one.** D133: *"most hardware and grocery
products carry no brand worth recording."* A permanent "Brand —" would be a row
every operator on those verticals reads past forever.

**Business details renders only where there is something to say.** Hardware's
`GET /products/attribute-schema` answers `{fields: []}` (verified live), so
those workspaces get no card at all rather than an empty one.

**A removed field still shows its values.** D161 lets a tenant replace their
business-details list; products created under the old one still carry those
values. Schema fields render first in the tenant's own order, then any leftover
keys, humanised — hiding them would silently lose data somebody typed in.

**`false` renders as "No".** It is a fact a customer asks about, and the one
value that vanishes from JSX and from every truthiness filter.

### `brandId` is optional on the type, and `categoryId` is not

Deliberate, and the one place this record departs from D134's reasoning.
`ManagedProduct` is built by 28 test fixtures; a required field edits every one
of them — restaurant and hardware included — to declare a null they do not care
about. D134 made `quantityType` required because the edit wizard round-trips it
and a dropped field is silently **saved back** as a wrong value. Nothing writes
brand: `ProductInput` has no such field, and the API's update guards on
`!== undefined`, so an omitted brand is preserved rather than cleared.

### Known gap, deliberately not closed here

**No UI assigns a brand to a product.** The API accepts `brandId` on create and
update; the wizard has never sent it, and the products list offers a brand
*filter* only. So the Brand row is correct and will stay invisible until brand
selection exists in the wizard. Displaying a brand and choosing one are
different pieces of work, and this record is the first.

### Mutation proof

Nine mutations, each failing the case that carries its decision:

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| a pending catalogue renders as `—` | the two "waits rather than claiming" cases, both resolvers |
| a failed catalogue renders as `—` | the two "says a failure was a failure" cases |
| the no-id short-circuit is dropped | the three "answers instantly" cases |
| schema order ignored, document order used | "the tenant's own labels, in the tenant's own order" |
| `false` dropped instead of rendered | "renders false as No", and the render case |
| Business details card always renders | both "renders no card" cases |
| Variations card always renders | "renders no card for a single-variant product" |
| a failed variations fetch reads as empty | "says so when the dimensions could not be loaded" |
| Brand row always renders | "shows no Brand row at all" |

### D170 — the SKU you can generate, and the opening stock that lands

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-10. Frontend only. No schema change,
no migration, no API change. Every business type.

### What was reported

> "sku not generating, sku genarate button now missing, and stock not apply
> properly"

Three symptoms, three different causes, and only the third was what it sounded
like. A fourth was visible in the same screenshot.

### 1. The SKU field made two contradictory promises

It carried a red `*` **and** a placeholder reading *"Enter SKU (or leave blank
to generate)"*. Blank was a hard validation error, so the generate path was
unreachable — and there was nothing at the other end of it either: the server
stores `dto.sku ?? null`, and **nothing in the repository generated a product
SKU at all**.

**Decided.** SKU is **optional**, which is what the server always said: the
column is nullable, the DTO marks it `@IsOptional()`, and the create maps
`?? null`. A **Generate** button fills a suggestion from the product's name,
editable before save. The length cap stays — dropping "required" must not drop
the rule the server actually enforces.

`Cement 50kg Bag` becomes `CEMENT-50KG-BAG-A7F`. The three-character suffix
exists because of `@@unique([tenantId, sku])`: two products with the same name
are ordinary in a shop that restocks under a new supplier code, and a bare slug
would collide and be refused at save for a reason the operator did not cause.
It is a **suggestion**, not an assignment — the field stays editable, and a
genuine clash is still the server's to report. Truncation to 80 characters
trims the NAME, never the suffix, or every long-named product would receive
the same SKU.

### 2. The Generate button was not missing — it was never on that screen

`Generate SKUs` lives inside the **variant matrix**. The reported screen is the
simple path (`hasVariations === false`), which has never had one. The existing
generator is also a *bulk* tool — prefix plus each option's first three letters
— so it has nothing to work from on a product with no options. The new button
is a different thing that happens to share a verb.

### 3. Opening stock was collected, validated, displayed, and dropped

The real defect, and the worst of the three.

`ProductCreatePayload` has **no `quantityOnHand` field**, so `buildCreateInput`
was structurally incapable of sending one. The operator's number was validated
by `optionalNumberError`, printed back on the Review step as "Opening stock",
and then discarded. `git log -S` finds no commit where it was ever sent.

Nothing caught it because the tests asserted the fields the payload **does**
send. It is the shape D134's spec was written for: every layer that held the
value did the right thing with it, and no layer handed it on.

**Decided.** The wizard posts an **inventory receipt** after the create, to the
existing `POST /inventory-receipts`.

Not `quantityOnHand` on the create, though `POST /products` would have taken it
and D121 says that column *is* what the till reads for a variant-less product —
so it would have looked fixed. It writes nothing else: no `BranchInventory`
row, no receipt in the Purchases tab, no weighted-average cost. The product's
own Inventory tab would still have read empty.

A receipt is the path the **variant** half already takes, and the path every
later GRN takes. Opening stock arriving by a different route than every
subsequent receipt is how a product's average cost comes to depend on how it
was created.

A **second call**, not a change to `POST /products`: that endpoint is shared by
every business type, and the variants path below it is already serialised the
same way. `idempotencyKey: opening-<productId>` — the server upserts on
`(tenantId, idempotencyKey)`, so a retry cannot receive the same stock twice.

A single product also gains the **opening-stock branch** control, and the rule
that goes with it: a receipt has to land somewhere. That card was inside the
variant matrix, which is part of how a single product came to have opening
stock with nowhere to put it; it is now **extracted and shared** rather than
copied.

### 3a. A precision mismatch, caught before shipping

`CreateReceiptDto`'s line is stricter than `CreateProductDto`: `unitCost` is
`maxDecimalPlaces: 2` and `quantityReceived` is `3`. The simple form had **no**
decimal cap, under a note explaining that only the checks the server makes are
worth blocking a save over — correct while those values only reached
`POST /products`.

Uncapped, a cost of `4.567` would have passed every check, created the product,
and then **400ed on the receipt**, leaving the operator with a product that has
no opening stock and an error naming a field they cannot see. Both are capped
now, which also matches the columns (`Decimal(12,2)`, `Decimal(12,3)`) — so the
extra digits were being rounded away in silence beforehand either way.

### 4. "Step 3 of 4" under a five-dot stepper

Four of the five steps hardcoded their position. D161 added Business details as
a fifth and gave only the new step a computed label. The step list is
per-tenant in any case (the attributes step exists only where the domain
declares fields), so no literal can be right for every workspace. One
`positionLabel`, computed by the shell, passed to all five.

### Two existing assertions were changed, deliberately

D16 forbids editing existing behavioural assertions to accommodate a
**refactor**. These are intentional behaviour changes with this record behind
them, and both were **strengthened** rather than relaxed:

- `validateStep returns the right shape per step` asserted that a blank SKU
  **and** a blank price both error. It now asserts the blank SKU does **not**
  and the blank price still does — a pair against one state, so "validation
  stopped running" cannot pass it.
- `simple mode refuses unusable cost / opening / reorder` had a positive case
  carrying `openingQuantity: '12'` with no branch. It now supplies the branch,
  keeping the assertion's original point, and a new line states the refusal
  when the branch is missing.

### Mutation proof

Twelve mutations, each failing the case that carries its decision:

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| the opening quantity is dropped (the reported bug, restored) | both `buildOpeningReceiptInput` payload cases |
| the receipt carries the wrong quantity | the same two |
| a variant product also posts a receipt | "leaves a variant product alone" |
| SKU is required again | "is not marked required" |
| the length cap goes with the required rule | "still refuses a SKU longer than the DTO allows" |
| `suggestSku` truncates the suffix, not the name | the length case and the separator case |
| `randomSkuSuffix` returns a constant | "it varies" |
| opening stock no longer needs a branch | "refuses to continue with stock but no branch" |
| the Generate button is not rendered | "fills the SKU from the product name" |
| the branch card is never rendered | "asks where the stock lands" |
| the cost cap is dropped | "refuses a cost the receipt line would reject" |
| the quantity cap is dropped | "refuses an opening quantity the receipt line would reject" |

### D171 — every buy-X-get-Y offer blocks the sale until it is complete

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-10. **Supersedes the non-blocking
half of [D166](#d155).** Frontend only. No schema change, no migration, no API
change. Every business type.

### What was asked

> "that tie problem we fix earlier i want it to handle like we handle with like
> 2 shirts 1 tie, same kind of lable with emoji, and proceed to payment needed
> to block utill add that, every buy x get y promotion needed to handle like
> that"

### What D166 decided, and why it is reversed

D166 asked the same question and answered it the other way, on my
recommendation and with the PO's agreement at the time:

> "You're totally right on the math — blocking a legitimate 5-tie sale would be
> terrible UX. The upsell notice is a much more elegant and modern approach."

The arithmetic behind that has not changed and is still in the code: a
"buy 5 get 1" on ONE product is six for the price of five, so a customer
holding five has earned nothing and owes nothing. `outstandingRewards` reports
nothing for them, correctly.

The PO has reversed the **policy** built on top of it. The reasoning is a
merchandising one, and it is theirs to make: a customer who has reached the
threshold of a free item must not be allowed to leave without it, and a till
that treats a same-product offer more softly than a cross-product one teaches
the cashier that some offers are optional.

### The decision

**Every unfinished `BUY_X_GET_Y` blocks payment, and says so identically.**

One list (`incompleteOffers`), one notice, one gate. The muted D166 prompt is
gone; both shapes now render the same primary-coloured 🎁 card with the same
sentence and the same "Payment is unavailable until the offer is complete."

### The cost, accepted with the decision

With `buy 5 get 1`, the gate closes at **5, 11, 17 —** every basket one unit
short of a complete group. A customer who wants exactly five ties cannot be
served until a sixth is added. That is not a side effect; it is the decision.
It is recorded here, in the code, and in the spec's assertion map, so nobody
rediscovers it at a counter and files it as a bug.

**Not blocked:** a basket nowhere near a threshold. One tie against a buy-five
offer reports nothing, and so does one shirt against a buy-two. The customer
has qualified for nothing, so there is nothing to complete — blocking there
would refuse every small basket in the shop.

### `incompleteOffers` is a union of outputs, not of arithmetic

The two halves stay separate functions because they compute genuinely
different things:

- `outstandingRewards` — a shortfall against an **entitlement**. The customer
  earned reward units they are not holding.
- `rewardUpsells` — a **remainder** inside an incomplete group of a
  same-product offer. Nothing is earned yet.

Neither reduces to the other. Merging their OUTPUT is safe; merging the sums
would not be. The union lives in `applier.ts` beside both halves rather than at
the call site, because two lists merged by a caller is two places to forget
one — and that failure would be silent and one-sided: a till that blocks one
shape and not the other.

### Assertions that were reversed, deliberately

D16 forbids editing behavioural assertions to accommodate a **refactor**. This
is an intentional policy reversal with this record behind it, and both
assertions were made **stronger**, not relaxed:

- `applier.spec.ts` had a case named *"NEVER blocks payment, at any quantity"*
  asserting `{1,5,6,11,12} → all false`. It now pins where the gate **closes**:
  `{1: false, 5: true, 6: false, 11: true, 12: false}`. "Never blocks" is
  satisfied by a function that returns nothing; "blocks at 5 and 11 and nowhere
  else" is not.
- The till spec required **Proceed to Payment enabled** with the prompt on
  screen, and required the prompt to be suppressed while a debt was live. Both
  now assert the opposite, and a new case asserts both offers are **named
  together** rather than one hidden — hiding one would leave a cashier
  completing an offer and finding the button still disabled with no reason
  given.

### A vacuous test of my own, caught by mutation

Every case I first wrote happened to need exactly **one** more unit, so a till
that hard-coded `1` in the notice passed all of them. Found by mutating the
count and watching nothing fail. A "buy 2 get 2" case with two in the basket
now pins the number and the plural. Recorded because it is the exact D30
failure mode, found in new work.

### Mutation proof

Seven mutations, each failing the case that carries its decision:

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| the same-product half is dropped from the union (D166's behaviour) | all three "blocks" cases |
| the cross-product half is dropped | the sameness case and the both-short case |
| the till stops gating on unfinished offers | all three "blocks" cases |
| the notice is not rendered | all three |
| the notice always says "one" | *only* "counts how many are still needed" |
| the 🎁 is dropped | the sameness case and the both-short case |
| an offer nowhere near completion also blocks | both "says nothing" controls |

### D172 — the dashboard's View Reports button opens Reports

**Status:** accepted and **built**, 2026-09-10. Frontend only, one href. No
schema change, no migration, no API change.

### What was reported

> "in dashbord in retail when click on 'view reports' btn its goes to sales its
> needed to go to reports"

### What was wrong

`admin-dashboard.tsx` built its secondary action as:

```ts
...(canReport ? [{ key: 'reports', label: 'View Reports', href: '/sales', ... }] : []),
```

Everything about that entry said Reports except the one field that decides
where the browser goes: the key is `reports`, the label is "View Reports", the
icon is `BarChart3`, and the gate is `REPORT_READ` — the same permission the
sidebar's `/reports` entry requires. `/reports` exists and always has.

Present since `99826df` ("add futuristic responsive role dashboards"), so it
has never worked.

### Why `/sales` is not simply a typo to be swept up elsewhere

Several KPI cards on the same screen point at `/sales` **correctly**, and that
is a deliberate pattern: a metric tile drills into the record list its number
came from, so Revenue and Gross Profit both land on the sales list. Those were
checked and left alone.

The difference is that this is a named ACTION, not a metric. Its only job is to
open Reports. So the fix is one href, and the test says "this action does not
link to `/sales`" rather than anything about the page as a whole — `/sales` is
a correct destination elsewhere on it.

### Why nothing caught it

Nothing rendered this dashboard. There was no `admin-dashboard` spec at all.

A wrong `href` is invisible to TypeScript (it is a `string`), invisible to
lint, and invisible to every other spec in the suite. The only thing that
catches it is an assertion about the destination, and there was none. That is
the real gap, and the reason this fix ships with a spec rather than a one-word
diff: the next wrong link would be just as silent.

### Mutation proof

Four mutations, each failing the case that carries its decision:

| Mutation | Fails |
|---|---|
| the original bug restored (`/reports` → `/sales`) | "View Reports opens Reports, not the sales list" |
| the action is dropped entirely | the same case |
| the `REPORT_READ` gate is removed | "is offered only to an operator who may read reports" |
| a sibling action's href is rewritten to `/reports` | "the actions it sits beside still point where they did" |

The last one is the control that matters: without it, "View Reports goes to
`/reports`" would pass for a dashboard whose every action had been rewritten to
the same string.
