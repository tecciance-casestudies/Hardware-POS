# Route → module matrix

Generated and enforced by
`apps/api/src/common/guards/route-module-matrix.spec.ts`, which reads Nest's own
route metadata off the real controller classes. **Do not edit the totals by hand** —
that spec fails when this document and the code disagree.

- Total routes: 338
- Module-guarded routes: 233
- Ungated routes: 105

## How to read the Guard column

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ENFORCED` | `@RequireModule` is applied today; `ModuleAccessGuard` denies the route when the tenant has the module switched off. |
| `shared-core` | Authentication, tenant isolation and permissions only. These routes must work for **every** business profile, so gating them would be wrong rather than merely unfinished. |
| `public-no-tenant` | `@Public()` route. `ModuleAccessGuard` denies any route requiring a module without an authenticated tenant (the `x-tenant-id` header is client-supplied and untrusted), so these **cannot** carry a module guard. Each enforces its own token instead. |

## Guard rollout in Slice 7.6

Applied at **controller level** where the whole controller belongs to one module:
`CustomersController` (CUSTOMERS), `ReturnsController` and `ReturnsSalesController`
(RETURNS), `SuppliersController` (SUPPLIERS), `SyncController` (QUICKBOOKS),
`DashboardController` (REPORTING), `UsersController` (USERS), `BranchesController`
(BRANCHES), `SettingsController` (SETTINGS). `QuotationsController` (QUOTATIONS)
was already gated in Slice 4.

Applied at **route level** where a controller is mixed:

- `QuickBooksController` — every route except the `@Public()` OAuth `callback`.
- `POST /products/:id/sync-to-quickbooks`, `POST /products/sync/mock`,
  `POST /customers/:id/sync-to-quickbooks` — QuickBooks operations living on
  otherwise provider-neutral controllers.

**Tile Shop is unaffected.** Every module gated above is in the legacy default set
(`LEGACY_TENANT_DEFAULTS`), so a tenant with no profile row resolves to having all
of them enabled and every route behaves exactly as before. This is asserted by
`platform-legacy-compatibility.spec.ts` and by the full Playwright suite.

## Guard rollout completed in Phase 1.5.9

**`RETAIL_POS` on the sale *write* path, payments, receipts, print jobs and
discounts** now carries `@RequireModule` — see the individual entries below.
Taking a sale, collecting payment and printing a receipt are retail workflows;
a Restaurant tenant reaches these routes only through the retail POS module.
When Restaurant Phase 2 lands the operational-order routes, they are a
separate model on separate routes and do not change this classification.

**Sale *reads* remain `SHARED_CORE`.** `GET /sales`, `GET /sales/:id` and
`GET /sales/report` every business profile needs to look up what it has already
sold. Access continues to depend on authentication, tenant isolation, branch
isolation where applicable, and the existing `sale:read` permission — removing
a module requirement is not removing protection. Asserted in
`route-module-matrix.spec.ts`.

**`INVENTORY` on `/products` and the category controllers.** Products are the
*catalogue*, which every business profile needs; `INVENTORY` means *stock
tracking*, which is already governed by `InventoryMode` and the catalogue provider
(decisions D28, D31). Gating catalogue CRUD on `INVENTORY` would stop a Restaurant
tenant managing its own products, contradicting the Phase 1 acceptance criteria.
Classified `SHARED_CORE` deliberately, not by omission.

**`DocumentsController` per-route gating.** Sale bills → `RETAIL_POS`, return
notes → `RETURNS`, settings previews → `SETTINGS`. Applied at the handler,
not the class, because the four routes serve three different modules.

## Every future Restaurant controller

Must carry `@RequireModule` and therefore fail closed. `route-module-matrix.spec.ts`
fails on any route it has not been told about, so a new Restaurant controller cannot
reach production unclassified.

D64: the tenant domain's declared catalogue attribute fields — one list
drives the wizard's generic attributes step and the server-side validator.

| Method | Path | Module | Guard | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/products/attribute-schema` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:read |

### ExchangesController

D128 (Phase 7): return one variant, issue another, settle the difference. The
transaction behind the `EXCHANGES` key **D2** reserved in the Phase 0 audit —
until now a module key with an A4 renderer and no workflow.

Gated on `EXCHANGES`, which retail carries and food service deliberately does not
(D2). Writes require **both** `return:create` and `sale:create`, because an
exchange really does both: requiring only one would let somebody who may not take
returns cause a refund through the side door.

| Method | Path | Module | Guard | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/exchanges` | EXCHANGES | ENFORCED | return:create + sale:create |
| POST | `/exchanges/preview` | EXCHANGES | ENFORCED | return:create + sale:create |
| GET | `/exchanges` | EXCHANGES | ENFORCED | return:read |
| GET | `/exchanges/:id` | EXCHANGES | ENFORCED | return:read |

The A4 note lives on `DocumentsController` with the other documents:

| Method | Path | Module | Guard | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/documents/exchanges/:exchangeId` | EXCHANGES | ENFORCED | return:read |

### AttributeLibraryController

D125 / D125a (Phase 5, `5.1` / `5.2`): the tenant option library — Size and
colour scales defined once and shared by every product that adopts them.

**Shared core, deliberately.** Any business selling variants benefits from
saying "Size" once, and gating it on a business type would be the D56 mistake —
read a capability, never a business type. A tenant that never creates a
definition sees an empty list, which is a real answer rather than a denial.

| Method | Path | Module | Guard | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/attribute-library` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:read |
| GET | `/attribute-library/:definitionId` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:read |
| POST | `/attribute-library` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:manage |
| PATCH | `/attribute-library/:definitionId` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:manage |
| DELETE | `/attribute-library/:definitionId` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:manage |

### BarcodesController

D125 Part 3 (Phase 5, `5.9`): the barcode audit and reissue pass. Sequenced
before label rendering, because an EAN-13 symbol cannot be produced from a
payload with a wrong check digit — 18 of the pilot's 20 codes.

The read is `product:read`: anyone who can browse the catalogue may see that it
has a problem. The reissue is `product:manage`, because it rewrites identifiers.

| Method | Path | Module | Guard | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/barcodes/audit` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:read |
| POST | `/barcodes/reissue` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:manage |

### LabelsController

D127 (Phase 5, `5.7`): render and queue a sheet of product labels as a
`PRODUCT_LABEL` print job — the only job type with no sale behind it.

Two endpoints rather than one: `preview` returns the HTML to look at, `print`
queues it. Printing is the irreversible half, so it is a deliberate second
action. Both report which variants could not be drawn rather than omitting them.

| Method | Path | Module | Guard | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| POST | `/labels/preview` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:manage |
| POST | `/labels/print` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:manage |

### ProductComponentsController

D65: a product's recipe (`ProductComponent`) — replace-all PUT, wizard-owned.
Writes are refused by the service for tenants without the components
capability.

| Method | Path | Module | Guard | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/products/:productId/components` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:read |
| PUT | `/products/:productId/components` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:manage |

### ProductModifierGroupsController

D62: the canonical home for modifier groups (shared catalogue). The
`/restaurant/modifier-groups` routes remain as a deprecated alias until their
sunset.

| Method | Path | Module | Guard | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/products/modifier-groups` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:read |
| POST | `/products/modifier-groups` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:manage |
| GET | `/products/modifier-groups/:groupId` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:read |
| PATCH | `/products/modifier-groups/:groupId` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:manage |

### Collections (CollectionsController, CollectionController, CollectionSectionsController, CatalogueEntriesController)

D62: the successor to the frozen menu authoring surface (D60). D66 (Phase 9)
reclassified the surface SHARED_CORE — the catalogue is shared core, and the
service refuses writes for tenants without the collections capability. The
LEGACY `/restaurant/menus…` reads keep their MENU_MANAGEMENT gate unchanged.

| Method | Path | Module | Guard | Permission |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| GET | `/branches/:branchId/collections` | SHARED_CORE | shared-core | product:read |

### PrintingController / KitchenPrintersController (D181 auto-printing)

D181, restoring D67: printers are added once per branch by the owner
(discovery-assisted), given a role (KITCHEN / CASHIER) and linked to stations;
the branch's auto-print switches and default printers live on the restaurant
branch config (`PUT /restaurant/branches/:branchId/config`). D67's per-user
printer choice is not restored — D152's station decides the device.

### PrintAgentController (D181 — the on-site agent's own API)

Not workspace-user routes: `@Public()` switches off the user stack and
`PrintAgentGuard` authenticates a branch-scoped **device** token, supplying
tenant and branch from the token's own row. Nothing about scope is read from
the request, so a stolen token can only drain its own branch's print queue.
