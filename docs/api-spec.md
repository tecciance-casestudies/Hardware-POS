# API Specification

REST API served by `apps/api` (NestJS). All routes are versioned under **`/v1`**.

> Draft contract — endpoints are not implemented yet. Shapes align with the models in
> [database-model.md](./database-model.md) and the shared enums in `packages/shared`.

## Conventions

- Base URL: `http://localhost:4000/v1` (dev). Configurable via `API_PORT` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
- JSON request/response bodies. Money as string decimals (e.g. `"12.50"`).
- Success envelope: `{ "data": ... }`. Error envelope: `{ "statusCode", "message", "error" }`.
- Auth: cashier logs in with a PIN and receives a session token (JWT/bearer) sent as
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on subsequent calls.
- Tenant context: until auth is wired, tenant-scoped endpoints require an `x-tenant-id`
  header (a temporary placeholder; the tenant will later be derived from the session token).
- Not-yet-implemented write/QuickBooks flows return `501 Not Implemented` in the standard
  error envelope.
- Pagination: `?page=1&pageSize=25` → `{ "data": { "items": [], "total", "page", "pageSize" } }`.

## Health

```
GET /v1/health
200 → { "status": "ok", "service": "hardware-pos-api", "timestamp": "..." }
```

## Auth

Two login methods issue the same bearer JWT (payload: `sub`, `tenantId`, `role`). Send it as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` on all other calls; the tenant is taken from the token.

```
POST /v1/auth/login                   # email + password (owner / admin / accountant)
body:  { "email": "owner@hardwarepos.test", "password": "password123" }
200 →  { "data": { "token": "...", "user": { "id", "tenantId", "name", "email", "role" } } }
401 →  invalid email or password

POST /v1/auth/pin-login               # PIN (cashier / manager); requires x-tenant-id header
headers: x-tenant-id: <tenantId>
body:  { "pin": "1111" }
200 →  { "data": { "token": "...", "user": { ... } } }
401 →  invalid PIN

GET  /v1/auth/me                      # current user + effective permissions
200 →  { "data": { "id", "tenantId", "name", "email", "role", "branchId", "permissions": [] } }
```

## Discounts (manual, product-wise)

Each sale line may carry a manual discount (`PERCENTAGE` or `FIXED`), a `discountReason`, and —
when it exceeds the operator's limit — an approver. Per-role limits (percentage of the line):

| Role              | Max discount without approval |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Cashier / Accountant | 0%                         |
| Manager           | 15%                           |
| Owner / Admin     | unlimited                     |

If a line's discount exceeds the acting user's limit, sale create returns **403** with a
machine-readable body so the front-end can pop a manager-PIN modal:

```
403 → { "statusCode": 403, "error": "DiscountApprovalRequired", "requiresApproval": true,
        "productId": "...", "requiredPercent": 20, "message": "..." }
```

The cashier then gets an approval token and retries with it on that line:

```
POST /v1/discounts/approve            # cashier submits a manager's PIN
body:  { "managerPin": "2222", "productId": "...", "discountType": "PERCENTAGE",
         "discountValue": 15, "reason": "loyal customer" }
200 →  { "data": { "approved": true,  "approvedByUserId": "...", "approvalToken": "<jwt, 15m>" } }
200 →  { "data": { "approved": false, "approvedByUserId": "...|null", "approvalToken": null,
                   "reason": "Discount exceeds this approver’s limit" } }
401 →  invalid manager PIN
```

The token binds tenant + product + discount type/value; attach it as `approvalToken` on the
sale item. The approver's own limit is re-checked against the real line at completion (so a
manager token cannot cover a discount beyond 15%). Completing a draft reuses the approver
already recorded on the draft line — no re-approval needed.

### Roles & permissions

Roles: `OWNER`, `ADMIN`, `MANAGER`, `CASHIER`, `ACCOUNTANT`. Routes are protected by a global
JWT guard plus role/permission guards. Summary of enforced access:

| Capability                         | Roles                          |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Create sales / take payments       | Cashier, Manager, Owner, Admin |
| Approve high discounts             | Manager, Owner, Admin          |
| View sync logs & QuickBooks status | Accountant, Owner, Admin       |
| Connect QuickBooks / manage users / settings | Owner, Admin         |
| Everything                         | Owner, Admin                   |

Unauthenticated → `401`; authenticated but not permitted → `403`.

## Products (read-only cache)

QuickBooks Online is the inventory master; products are a **read-only local cache**. There are
no create/update/delete product endpoints — the POS never edits stock. The cache is refreshed
only via sync (mock sync below, real QuickBooks sync later).

```
GET /v1/products?search=hammer&page=1&pageSize=25          # free-text (name/sku/barcode)
200 → { "data": { "items": [ { "id", "quickbooksItemId", "sku", "barcode", "name", "unitType", "unitPrice", "quantityOnHand", "syncStatus" } ], "total", "page", "pageSize" } }

GET /v1/products/search?name=&sku=&barcode=&categoryId=&isActive=true   # structured filters (AND)
200 → paginated products

GET /v1/products/barcode/{barcode}
200 → { "data": { "id", "name", "unitPrice", "quantityOnHand", ... } }
404 → unknown barcode

GET /v1/products/{id}
200 → single product   |   404 → not found

POST /v1/products/sync/mock            # simulate a QuickBooks catalog pull (owner/admin only)
200 → { "data": { "created", "updated", "total", "categories" } }
403 → lacks quickbooks:manage

GET /v1/categories                     # product categories with product counts
200 → { "data": [ { "id", "name", "parentId", "isActive", "_count": { "products" } } ] }
```

All product/category read routes require `product:read`; every role has it.

## Customers (read-only cache)

```
GET /v1/customers?query=acme
200 → { "data": { "items": [ { "id", "qboId", "name", "email", "phone" } ], ... } }
```

## Sales

All sale routes derive tenant + cashier from the JWT. Create routes require `sale:create`,
reads require `sale:read`. The POS never reduces inventory — QuickBooks is the master; local
stock is refreshed by product sync after a QuickBooks push succeeds.

```
POST /v1/sales/draft                   # build a DRAFT sale (totals computed, nothing charged)
body: { "branchId", "registerId?", "customerId?",
        "items": [ { "productId", "quantity", "unitPrice?",
                     "discountType?": "PERCENTAGE|FIXED", "discountValue?",
                     "discountReason?", "approvalToken?" } ] }
200 → { "data": <sale with items, status DRAFT, syncStatus NOT_SYNCED> }

POST /v1/sales/complete                # complete a draft (saleId) OR a full cart in one shot
body (draft):    { "saleId", "customerId?", "payments": [ { "method", "amount", "reference?" } ] }
body (one-shot): { "branchId", "registerId?", "customerId?", "items": [ ... ], "payments": [ ... ] }
201 → { "data": <sale status COMPLETED, paymentStatus, quickbooksDocumentType, syncStatus PENDING> }
400 → validation error (empty cart, price changed, insufficient stock,
       unapproved high discount, or credit/partial sale without a customer)

# Completion pipeline: validate items → validate prices vs cache → check stock →
#   subtotal → product-wise discounts → tax (if rate > 0) → total → save sale,
#   items, payments → enqueue an outbound QuickBooks sync job.
# Transaction type: paidAmount >= total → SALES_RECEIPT; otherwise INVOICE (customer required).
# Payments: full, partial, or none (full credit) are all supported.

GET  /v1/sales?page=1&pageSize=25&syncStatus=FAILED
200 → paginated sales history (syncStatus per sale)

GET  /v1/sales/{id}
200 → full sale with items, payments, customer

POST /v1/sales/{id}/sync               # push the sale to QuickBooks (mock for now)
200 → sale marked SYNCED with a mock quickbooksDocumentId; payments get mock ids;
      the sync job closes and a SyncLog entry is written
400 → sale is not COMPLETED
```

## Receipts & print jobs

Printing is browser-based for v1: each endpoint returns a self-contained printable HTML
document (with a Print button) inside a `PrintJob`. A hardware sale prints the **customer
receipt** by default; if any line's product has `requiresWarehousePickup = true`, a
**warehouse picking copy** (listing only the pickup items) is created alongside it.

```
POST /v1/receipts/{saleId}/customer    # customer receipt (+ auto warehouse copy if needed)
201 → { "data": { "receiptNumber", "warehousePickupRequired": bool,
                   "printJob": { "id", "type": "CUSTOMER_RECEIPT", "status", "html" },
                   "warehousePrintJob": { ... } | null } }
400 → sale not completed   |   404 → sale not found

POST /v1/receipts/{saleId}/warehouse   # (re)generate the warehouse picking copy
201 → { "data": { "id", "type": "WAREHOUSE_PICKING", "status": "PENDING", "html" } }
400 → no items on the sale require warehouse pickup

GET  /v1/receipts/sale/{saleId}        # stored customer-receipt record
GET  /v1/receipts/{id}

GET  /v1/print-jobs?saleId=&type=CUSTOMER_RECEIPT|WAREHOUSE_PICKING&status=PENDING|PRINTED|FAILED
200 → paginated print jobs (each includes its printable html)

POST /v1/print-jobs/{id}/mark-printed  # mark a job PRINTED after the browser prints it
200 → { "data": { "id", "status": "PRINTED", "printedAt" } }
```

Generating receipts / marking printed requires `sale:create`; listing/reading requires `sale:read`.

## Sync

### Sync queue & worker

Completing a sale writes a `SyncJob` row (`type = SALES_SYNC`, `status = PENDING`) **in the same
transaction** as the sale — a transactional outbox, so a sale is never lost even if QuickBooks is
down. A background **worker** polls the queue and drains it:

1. recovers jobs stuck in `SYNCING` (crash recovery) back to `PENDING`,
2. atomically **claims** due `PENDING` jobs (→ `SYNCING`, `attempts++`) — safe for concurrent workers,
3. dispatches each to a handler by `type` (`SALES_SYNC` → QuickBooks sales sync),
4. on success marks `SYNCED`; on failure **reschedules with linear backoff** until `maxAttempts`,
   then leaves it `FAILED` for a manual retry. The error message is stored on the job and logged.

The worker is a thin, swappable layer: the queue service, handler registry, and producers are the
seams to move to **BullMQ/Redis** later without touching sale completion or the handlers. Configure
via `SYNC_WORKER_ENABLED` (`false` to disable, e.g. when BullMQ takes over), `SYNC_WORKER_INTERVAL_MS`,
`SYNC_WORKER_BATCH_SIZE`, `SYNC_RETRY_BACKOFF_MS`, `SYNC_STALE_MS`.

```
GET /v1/sync/logs?entityType=SALE&status=FAILED&page=1
200 → { "data": { "items": [ { "id", "entityType", "entityId", "direction", "status", "attempt", "error", "createdAt" } ], ... } }

POST /v1/sync/sales/{id}/retry        # manual "Retry Sync": re-queue a sale's job (attempts reset,
202 → { "data": { "id", "syncStatus": "PENDING" } }   #   status → PENDING); the worker retries it

POST /v1/sync/products/refresh        # on-demand inbound catalog pull (admin)
202 → { "data": { "started": true } }
```

## QuickBooks connection (OAuth 2.0)

Real Intuit OAuth 2.0. Configure `QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_ID`, `QUICKBOOKS_CLIENT_SECRET`,
`QUICKBOOKS_REDIRECT_URI`, `QUICKBOOKS_ENVIRONMENT`, and `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`. Access and
refresh tokens are stored **encrypted at rest** (AES-256-GCM) and never returned to the client.

```
GET  /v1/quickbooks/connect            # owner/admin — 302 → Intuit authorization screen
                                       # state is a signed, short-lived JWT carrying the tenant

GET  /v1/quickbooks/callback           # public redirect target from Intuit
                                       # verifies state, exchanges the code for tokens, stores
                                       # them (encrypted) + realmId + expiry, then
                                       # 302 → {WEB_ORIGIN}/quickbooks?connected=1
                                       # on failure → …/quickbooks?error=<message>

POST /v1/quickbooks/disconnect         # owner/admin — revokes the token and removes the connection
200 → { "data": { "disconnected": true } }

GET  /v1/quickbooks/status             # quickbooks:read — never exposes tokens
200 → { "data": { "connected": true, "realmId": "...", "environment": "sandbox", "tokenExpiresAt": "..." } }
```

Access tokens are auto-refreshed (using the stored refresh token) when expired; refresh happens
server-side only and is used by the sync worker.

## QuickBooks product sync

Pulls the item catalogue from QuickBooks into the local product cache. Uses the stored access
token (refreshing it first if expired), queries `Item` records, imports **Inventory** and
**NonInventory** items (other types such as `Service` are skipped), and upserts them by
`(tenantId, quickbooksItemId)`. Mapped fields: `name`, `sku`, `description`, `unitPrice`,
`quantityOnHand`, `type`, `isActive`. Each run records an inbound `SyncLog` entry.

```
POST /v1/quickbooks/sync-products      # quickbooks:manage — requires an active connection
200 → { "data": { "created": 4, "updated": 0, "skipped": 2, "failed": 0, "total": 6 } }
404 → QuickBooks is not connected
```

## QuickBooks sales sync

Pushes a completed sale to QuickBooks. A **fully paid** sale becomes a **Sales Receipt**; a
**credit / partial** sale becomes an **Invoice**, and when any amount was paid a **Payment** is
created and linked to that invoice. Sale line items reference their `quickbooksItemId` when the
product has been synced. Product-wise discounts are baked into each line's net amount (QuickBooks
has no per-line discount field) and noted in the line description — see the `TODO(accountant)`
comments where an itemised discount line or document-level discount would need confirmation.

The QuickBooks document id is stored on the sale, the QuickBooks payment id on the sale's
payments, and every attempt records a `SyncLog`. If the push fails, the sale is **kept in the POS**
and marked `FAILED` (with `syncError`) — never rolled back.

```
POST /v1/quickbooks/sync-sale/{saleId} # quickbooks:manage — sale must be COMPLETED
200 → { "data": { "saleId", "saleNumber", "status": "SYNCED"|"FAILED",
                  "quickbooksDocumentType": "SALES_RECEIPT"|"INVOICE",
                  "quickbooksDocumentId", "quickbooksPaymentId", "message" } }
404 → QuickBooks not connected / sale not found

POST /v1/quickbooks/retry/{syncLogId}  # quickbooks:manage — re-run the sale sync for a failed log
200 → same shape as sync-sale (attempt count incremented)
```
