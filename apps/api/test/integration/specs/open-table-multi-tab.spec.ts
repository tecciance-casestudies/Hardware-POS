/**
 * D104 — one joined table, several tabs.
 *
 * A party of four takes an arrangement of M1+M2 (six seats). Two more guests
 * arrive as a SEPARATE party and take a second tab on the same arrangement,
 * with their own bill. The physical tables come back only when the LAST tab
 * closes.
 *
 * This supersedes two statements that shipped before it: D49's "the
 * arrangement ends with the tab", and the one-live-session-per-table rule in
 * `openSession`. Both are relaxed for `kind = OPEN` ONLY, which is why the last
 * test here re-proves the physical rule rather than trusting that nothing else
 * moved.
 *
 * Non-vacuous per D30. Every claim is paired:
 *
 * - the arrangement SURVIVES the first close (positive) AND its members are
 *   asserted NOT to have gone AVAILABLE (negative) — an implementation that
 *   released nothing at all would satisfy only the second;
 * - the seat check REFUSES an overfilling party (negative) AND admits the same
 *   party at a size that fits (positive) — a server that refused everything
 *   would satisfy only the first;
 * - a PHYSICAL table still refuses a second session, so the relaxation is
 *   proven scoped rather than global.
 *
 * The close-then-release ORDERING is load-bearing and is pinned here:
 * `settleBilledSession` marks its own session CLOSED before the fulfilment
 * provider asks "is anybody else still sitting here", so the plain count in
 * `releaseOpenTable` excludes the tab that is closing. Were that reordered, the
 * last close would see itself as a survivor and never dissolve — which is
 * exactly what the third test would catch.
 *
 * D178 re-timed "close". A tab is done when its bill is PAID, not when the
 * waiter sends it to the till, so `settleTab` below does both — send, then
 * pay in full — and the release facts the old `/close` response used to carry
 * (`openTableRelease`) are read back from the tables themselves, which is
 * where the claim lives anyway. Every assertion about WHICH members come back
 * and WHEN is unchanged; only the trigger moved, and one test is added to pin
 * the new half: sending alone frees nothing.
