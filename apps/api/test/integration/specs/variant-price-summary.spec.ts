/**
 * D44 — the products list must price a variant product from its variants.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `Product.unitPrice` and `Product.sku` are legacy fallbacks the schema says are
 * "not read" once `hasVariants` is true. The admin products list, the promotion
 * product picker and the product-detail KPI all read them anyway, so every
 * variant product in the pilot catalogue rendered `Rs 0.00` and `SKU —` while
 * its variants were priced 500 to 4,300.
 *
 * ## What can only be proven here, not in a unit spec
 *
 *  • `groupBy` with `_min`/`_max` over a `Decimal(12,2)` column returns Prisma
 *    `Decimal` objects, not numbers. A mocked client would happily hand back
 *    JavaScript numbers and prove nothing about the conversion — and a Decimal
 *    that reached the client would serialise as an object, not a price.
 *  • the `isActive` filter, which is a real WHERE clause against real rows.
 *  • that `paginate` carries the widened row through untouched.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * A legacy product and a variant product are asserted in the SAME list response.
 * "The variant product has a span" alone would pass for a service that ranged
 * every product; the legacy row asserts the old reading is untouched, which is
 * what protects the 40-odd hardware and restaurant products already priced
 * correctly. The mutation proof at the end runs the assertions against the
 * defect as it shipped.

/*
 * MUTATION PROOF (D30 §5) — every line below is a run that was actually
 * executed against this spec, not a prediction.
 *
 * 1. The defect as it shipped — no aggregate is fetched, so the screens read the
 *    parent columns (`variantIds` forced to `[]`):
 *      × returns the span, as numbers, across active variants only
 *      × collapses to a single figure when every variant agrees
 *      × leaves a legacy product alone, in the same response
 *      × does not leak another tenant's variants into the span
 *      √ reports no variants once every variant is deactivated
 *          — NOTED HONESTLY: "no aggregate at all" and "every variant is
 *            deactivated" are observationally identical (count 0, null bounds),
 *            so that case cannot distinguish them and is not claimed to. The
 *            other four carry the guard.
 *      4 of 5 fail.
 *
 * 2. Dropping `isActive: true` from the groupBy WHERE:
 *      × returns the span, as numbers, across active variants only
 *          (reads min 1 / max 9999 — BOTH bounds corrupted, which is why the
 *           fixture deactivates a variant on either side of the real span)
 *      × reports no variants once every variant is deactivated
 *      2 of 5 fail. The three that pass have no inactive variants to mis-read.
 *
 * 3. Dropping `tenantId` from the groupBy WHERE:
 *      × does not leak another tenant's variants into the span
 *      1 of 5 fails — that test is the ONLY guard on tenant isolation here,
 *      which is exactly why it is written as its own case rather than folded
 *      into another assertion.
 *
 * 4. Returning the raw Prisma `Decimal` instead of `Number(...)`:
 *      × returns the span, as numbers, across active variants only
 *      × collapses to a single figure when every variant agrees
 *      × does not leak another tenant's variants into the span
 *      3 of 5 fail. This is the mutation a mocked client could never catch: a
 *      Decimal reaching the browser serialises as an object, not a price.

/**
 * D44 (PO decision, 2026-09-04) — the EXPORT reads the same rule as the screen.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `products-report.service` wrote `Number(p.unitPrice)` and `p.sku` straight into
 * the spreadsheet, so every variant product exported as `0.00` with a blank SKU
 * while the products list beside it showed the real range. The screens were fixed
 * in 4.17 and the export was left behind — the same "one caller updated, the
 * other forgotten" shape as 4.15 and 4.21.
 *
 * ## Why this is an integration test
 *
 * The unit tests for `variantPriceLabel` prove the RULE. What they cannot prove
 * is that the report calls it — which is exactly what was broken. This renders a
 * real workbook from real rows and reads the cell back, so a report that
 * regressed to the parent column fails here even though the shared helper stays
 * green.
