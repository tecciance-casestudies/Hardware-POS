/**
 * D68 — the kitchen board replaces the kitchen printer.
 *
 * What this covers is the whole delivery path: a waiter sends a round, and
 * the food appears on a screen somebody is rostered to. There is no printer
 * behind it, which is the point — so the assertions are about the ROW being
 * complete and reachable, and about who is allowed to touch it.
 *
 * D181 brought unattended printing back as a COPY of the board, and this
 * spec's fixture configures no printer on purpose: the board must be whole
 * with nothing to print to. The "no print work" negatives below therefore
 * still hold, now as the proof that a branch without a printer enqueues
 * nothing and loses nothing. The positive side — a configured printer gets
 * its attempt and the board is untouched by it — lives in
 * `auto-printing.spec.ts`.
 *
 * D30 compliance:
 *
 *   • Every "printing is gone" negative is paired with a positive that the
 *     ticket itself exists and carries its context. A spec that only asserted
 *     "no print attempts" would pass just as happily against a build that
 *     generated no tickets at all.
 *   • The permission tests assert BOTH directions on the same user: kitchen
 *     staff can complete a ticket AND are refused the till. A one-sided test
 *     passes against a role that holds nothing, and against one that holds
 *     everything, respectively.
 *   • Idempotency is proven by identity of the recorded completer, not by
 *     absence of an error — a second call that silently rewrote the name
 *     would still "succeed".
 *   • D152's per-station split is asserted on the ROWS as well as on the
 *     board, and never by counting alone: each ticket is matched to the
 *     station it claims AND to the dishes that station's links actually
 *     route, and the union of the tickets' items is asserted equal to the
 *     round's own items. "Two tickets" is satisfiable by a fixture that lost
 *     a dish between them; "exactly these dishes, and no others" is not.
 *   • The Main fallback is asserted at a branch holding four other active
 *     stations, one of them NAMED "Main Kitchen" on a different code. An
 *     unlinked dish reaching a ticket proves nothing at a one-station branch
 *     — D67's retired sole-station sweep did that much — and a build
 *     resolving Main by display name would send it to the demo hot line.
 *   • D174's station cut is asserted with every number DISTINCT — per lane,
 *     per station, and against the branch — so a chip counting the other
 *     station, the branch, or the open lane each land on a different wrong
 *     integer; and with a D147-window ticket on no station that is in the
 *     branch's numbers and in neither station's.
 *   • D175's filters are asserted as SETS of ticket ids over real rows, never
 *     as totals alone, and every negative — a leg gone from the search, a
 *     takeaway absent under a table set, a stationless ticket outside every
 *     station's set — is paired with the read that still finds the same
 *     ticket the way the contract now says it is found.

 * D152 — the split is back: one ticket per station, and nothing lands on none.

 * only place to link a dish to a station was the product wizard's
 * branch-scoped Step 3 multi-select, which renders empty when no branch is
 * selected, so dishes were created linked to nothing — and an item linked to
 * nothing reached NO ticket at all unless the branch happened to have exactly
 * one active station (D67's sole-station sweep). Ordered, billed, never
 * cooked.
 *
 * D152 removes both halves of that objection rather than the split: the
 * station is CHOSEN when the menu item is created, and every branch has a
 * `MAIN` station that anything still unlinked routes to. So the cards come
 * back, and the drop does not.
 *
 * This block is written to be hostile to its own claim (D30):
 *
 *   • FOUR active stations before a round is sent, FIVE after — the submit
 *     creates Main. The count is load-bearing in both directions: D67's sweep
 *     rescued an unlinked dish only at a branch with exactly ONE active
 *     station, so "it reached a ticket" proved at a one-station branch would
 *     be indistinguishable from the behaviour D152 replaces.
 *   • One of those stations is NAMED "Main Kitchen", on code `KIT` — the
 *     seed's demo hot line, deliberately distinct from Main. The fallback
 *     resolves by CODE, so every "on Main" assertion below names the id of
 *     the `MAIN`-coded row and asserts the hot line received nothing. A build
 *     that matched the display name would fail here and nowhere else.
 *   • Every split assertion is paired with a UNION check — the multiset of
 *     the tickets' items against the round's own items. "Two tickets" is
 *     satisfiable by a fixture that lost a dish between them; "exactly these
 *     dishes, in these quantities, and no others" is not.

/**
 * D156 — a waiter sees the whole floor, and the narrowing is permission-driven.
 *
 * ## What changed, and why the pairs are the other way up now
 *
 * D70 withheld `TABLE_SESSION_VIEW_ALL` from the Waiter template, so these
 * cases used to assert the opposite of what they assert below: waiter A could
 * not see, read or write waiter B's table. D156 grants the key, because the
 * mixing D70 was protecting against is a question of DEFAULTS (the floor plan
 * and the POS picker open on "my tables") and withholding the read made the
 * routine case of table service impossible — covering a colleague on a break, a
 * shift change mid-service, answering a guest about an order you did not take.
 *
 * ## Why the narrowing is still asserted
 *
 * The server-side scope is unchanged and still the authority: it is keyed on a
 * permission, and a tenant can compose a role without it through RolesApi. No
 * seeded template lacks it any more, so a spec that exercised only the seeded
 * roles would leave `sessionScope()` asserted in ONE direction — the shape D30
 * calls vacuous. `trainee` below is the second direction: a custom role with
 * TABLE_VIEW and no VIEW_ALL, narrowed exactly as a waiter used to be, through
 * the same routes in the same test.
 *
 * Mutation-proven (run against the template itself): removing
 * `TABLE_SESSION_VIEW_ALL` from the Waiter template — i.e. reverting to D70 —
 * fails exactly the three waiter-facing cases (the floor listing with its
 * names, the per-id reads, the colleague's-table writes) and leaves the
 * supervisor case and the TRAINEE_WAITER control green: 3 failed, 29 passed.

 * D174 — a station scopes the list AND the counts, together, over real rows.
 *
 * The PO's report: on the kitchen page the Done tab carried a number only
 * while "All stations" was selected. That was D152's own doing — on the lane
 * the board was not fetching, `laneCount` answered null under a station cut,
 * because the counts came from the server and the server counted the BRANCH,
 * and "Done 7" over a lane about to draw the grill's two cards was judged
 * worse than no number. The PO ruled otherwise: D142b's rule that EVERY chip
 * carries its number holds under a station cut too, and the number is that
 * station's own. So `?stationId=` narrows the list and all three counts in
 * the one snapshot D154 made, and the standalone counts route takes the same
 * param so the two exposures stay pinned to each other.
 *
 * The unit specs pin the SHAPE — one station key on all four queries, in one
 * transaction. What only real rows can prove is that Postgres, given that
 * shape, hands back the station's tickets AND the station's numbers, and that
 * the counts route — its own DTO, its own guard — says the same three
 * integers. The fixture is therefore built the way D154's was, with every
 * number DISTINCT per lane, per station, and against the branch, so a chip
 * counting the other station, the branch, or the open lane each land on a
 * different wrong integer:
 *
 *   Pass    { 4, 2, 1 }
 *   Grill   { 2, 1, 3 }   plus one bumped three days ago: completed, NOT today
 *   (none)  { 1, 0, 0 }   a D147-window ticket, its stationId nulled by hand
 *   branch  { 7, 3, 4 }   = Pass + Grill + (none), lane by lane
 *
 * The stationless row is load-bearing. D174 says a ticket cut during the D147
 * window belongs to NO station and is therefore in no station's count, while
 * it is still in the "All stations" numbers. Without it the branch total would
 * simply be the two stations' sum, and a build that folded a null-station row
 * into whichever station was asked for would pass every assertion here.

 * into it found the grill's tickets AND every Grilled Seer Fish the pass had

 * has no table and matches only while the table axis is unfiltered.
 *
 * The unit spec pins the emitted `where`. What only rows can prove is that the
 * two axes really are AND-ed across and OR-ed within, that the table clause
 * really reaches through the SESSION (a ticket carries no table of its own),
 * and that the two retired legs are gone from the wire — so this fixture is

 * axes can be told apart — the table set finds it, and the union of EVERY
 * station in the branch does not. And every set assertion is on ids, never on
