/**
 * D159 — handing an open table to a different waiter.
 *
 * The PO's case: mid-service a party asks for someone else, and the shift
 * supervisor has to be able to answer. The route is owner-held; what this spec
 * pins is the SERVICE's three refusals, because each of them is a state the
 * screen would otherwise write and the round submit would then reject —
 * failing later, somewhere else, to somebody who did not do it.
 *
 * ## Why each is a pair
 *
 *   - "refuses a closed session" is indistinguishable from "refuses
 *     everything" unless an open one is proven to go through on the same
 *     service;
 *   - "refuses somebody who cannot serve" is the same: the assignable list is
 *     derived from ROLE permissions, so the positive case has to come from a
 *     role that genuinely carries `order:send-to-kitchen` rather than from a
 *     name;
 *   - the write is asserted by its ARGUMENTS, not just by "no throw": the
 *     defect that matters is updating the wrong row, or writing more than the
 *     waiter (the rounds' own submitters, and the bill, must be untouched).
 *
 * Mutation-proven, each run against the service itself:
 *   1. the assignable check dropped — 1 failed, 6 passed: a table handed to
 *      somebody whose role cannot send it to the kitchen;
 *   2. the OPEN check dropped — 1 failed, 6 passed: a closed session, and with
 *      it a billed one, silently reassigned;
 *   3. the update writing `{ waiterUserId, status }` (touching more than the
 *      waiter) — 1 failed, 6 passed;
 *   4. the serving-role query losing its `permissions` filter (so every role
 *      counts as able to serve) — 5 failed, 2 passed: it widens the assignable
 *      list AND the refusal that rests on it, which is why the stub asserts
 *      that filter is present rather than trusting the result.
