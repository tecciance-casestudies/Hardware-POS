/**
 * D195 — the shop's logo on the refund slip.
 *
 * D193 put the logo on the sales receipt and the A4 letterhead and **missed
 * this one**, which is the receipt a customer is handed while they are already
 * unhappy and the one they keep as proof the shop took the goods back.
 *
 * ## What makes these non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * The positive case asserts the bytes arrive as a `data:` URI, not merely that
 * an `<img>` exists. A template emitting `src="/uploads/…"` would satisfy
 * "there is an image" and print a broken icon — that was exactly D193's A4
 * defect, and repeating it here would be repeating it knowingly.
 *
 * The negative case is what stops the change reaching tenants it should not.
 * Every workspace without a logo — which is every workspace until someone
 * uploads one — must print precisely what it printed before, so it asserts no
 * `<img>` at all AND that the shop name is still there.
 *
 * The shop name is asserted in BOTH cases. A logo that replaced it would pass a
 * test that only looked for the image, and a refund slip whose branding failed
 * to render would then carry nothing identifying the shop that owes the money.
 *
 * The refund TOTAL is asserted alongside, because this document's job is not
 * decoration: a change to the header must not disturb the figure the customer
 * is checking.
