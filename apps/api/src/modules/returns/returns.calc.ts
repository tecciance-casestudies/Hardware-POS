   *     exempt lines) refunded tax that was never charged.
   *   • A TAXABLE LINE in a mixed basket gets the true base as its denominator,
   *     so it refunds everything it paid instead of a diluted share.
   *   • RECONCILIATION — the shares sum to 1 by construction, so Σ refunds
   *     equals the sale's tax exactly. That holds for a full return AND for any
   *     sequence of partial ones, which is why no line has to "absorb" a

   * of tax than the sale charged.

   * What a NULL rate actually means (corrected in 3.16).
   *
   * TWO origins produce it, not one. The original comment here said a null rate
   * meant "this sale predates the snapshot", and that is only half true:
   *
   *   1. The sale predates the 3.8 migration — nothing recorded a rate because
   *      the column did not exist.
   *   2. The sale is a RESTAURANT bill. Since D58 `table-sessions` and
   *      `takeaway` settle by projecting order items into SaleItem rows, and
   *      `ProjectedSaleItem` carries no `taxRatePercent`, so every restaurant
   *      line is written NULL — on a bill settled TODAY, not only on history.
   *
   * Both take the fallback, and both are correct under it today: a restaurant
   * bill is charged one flat rate, and `computeRestaurantTotals` never consults
   * `Product.taxable`, so it has no exempt lines. With no exemptions the
   * proportional method and the weighted one agree exactly.
   *
   * The invariant that does NOT hold, and must not be relied on: "a null rate
   * means an old sale". If the restaurant path ever gains per-product exemption
   * while still writing NULL, these refunds break SILENTLY — the fallback would
   * refund tax on an exempt line that was never charged, which is precisely the
   * defect 3.11 removed for retail. The fix belongs at the WRITE (snapshot the
   * rate onto `ProjectedSaleItem`), not at this read; raised with the restaurant
   * team in 3.16 rather than patched here, because their module is theirs.
   *
   * A sale is still never MIXED, which is what this check does rely on: retail
   * writes a rate on every line (3.9) and restaurant writes none on any, so
   * `taxWeightTotal` is null exactly when the line rate is.
