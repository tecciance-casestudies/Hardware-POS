/**
 * D183 — the receipt says what crossed the counter and what went back.
 *
 * ## What was reported
 *
 * A sale totalling Rs 2,478 was paid with Rs 5,000. The payment screen showed
 * "Change Rs 2,522.00" — twice — and the printed bill showed only
 * `Paid 2,478 / Balance 0.00`. The customer had no record of the 5,000 they
 * handed over or the 2,522 they got back.
 *
 * ## Why nothing caught it
 *
 * Nothing tested this renderer. `renderCustomerReceipt` had no spec at all, so
 * every row it prints was unasserted.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * The rows are asserted with their VALUES, not their labels. A renderer that
 * printed "Cash received" against the total rather than the tender would pass
 * a label check and be exactly the bug being fixed.
 *
 * Every positive case is paired with the case one step away from it — exact
 * money, under-tender, and no tender at all — because the guard is the whole
 * decision. A renderer that printed the rows unconditionally would satisfy
 * "the rows appear when there is change" and put `Change Rs. 0.00` on every
 * cash receipt in the shop.
 *
 * And each case asserts `Paid` and `Balance` are UNCHANGED in the same render.
 * That is the property the fix turns on: the tender is a receipt fact, and
 * writing it into either of those would put a walk-in customer on the debtors
 * list or overstate the drawer.
