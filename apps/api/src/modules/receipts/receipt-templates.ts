/**
 * D185 — what the customer actually needs to read, and nothing twice.
 *
 * ## The report
 *
 * After D183/D184 a cash sale with change printed SEVEN rows, three of which
 * carried the same number:
 *
 *     Total 3,200 | Paid 3,200 | Balance 0.00
 *     Cash received 3,500 | Change 300 | PAID | Cash 3,200
 *
 * `Paid` equals the total on any settled sale, `Balance` is 0.00 by definition
 * when it is, and the trailing `Cash` row is the payment breakdown repeating
 * the total a third time. The two figures the customer came for — what they
 * handed over and what they get back — were buried among five that told them
 * nothing.
 *
 * ## What is printed instead
 *
 * On an over-tendered cash sale, four rows:
 *
 *     Total | Cash | Balance | Status
 *
 * `Cash` is what was handed over; `Balance` is what comes back. On this
 * receipt there is nothing owed, so `Balance` is unambiguous — and it is the
 * word the PO asked for.
 *
 * ## What is NOT changed
 *
 * Every other receipt keeps `Paid` / `Balance` and its full payment breakdown,
 * because there `Balance` means money still OWED and the breakdown is the only
 * record of how a split or credit sale was settled. A restaurant bill, a card
 * sale, a credit sale and every reprint are byte-for-byte as before.
 *
 * ## Only a single-payment sale takes the short layout
 *
 * On a SPLIT tender the change is not `tendered — total`: the cash covers
 * only its own share, so that subtraction is meaningless and would print a
 * negative. The till never sends a tender for a split (it is sent only in
 * single-method CASH mode), so the condition states what is already true
 * rather than guarding a case the caller can reach.
 *
 * A split therefore keeps `Paid` / `Balance` and its full breakdown, which
 * is the only record of how it was settled.
 */
/*
 * D188 — the wording is the restaurant bill's, because it is the trade's.
 *
 * `thermal-bill.ts` has printed `Bill Amount` / `Paid Amount` / `Bal. Amount`
 * on every food-service slip since it was written, and a Sri Lankan customer
 * reads those three lines on any till roll they are handed. The retail
 * receipt said `Total` / `Paid` / `Balance` — correct English, and not what
 * the paper in this market says.
 *
 * Both layouts now use the same three labels, which is the other gain: the
 * short over-tender layout and the ordinary one read identically, so a
 * cashier is not learning two receipts.
 *
 * The restaurant renderer appends ` :` to each label. That is NOT copied:
 * this receipt puts a colon on none of its other rows (Subtotal, Tax,
