/**
 * D186 — a reprint keeps the tender the first print recorded.
 *
 * ## What was reported
 *
 * D183–D185 put "Cash" and "Balance" on the receipt printed at the till, and
 * viewing the same bill from Sales still showed `Balance 0.00`.
 *
 * ## The cause, and why no migration was needed
 *
 * The number was already on disk. `Receipt.content` is a JSON column and the
 * receipt data is spread into it, so the FIRST print stored `amountTendered`
 * without anyone designing for it. But `upsertReceipt` overwrites `content` on
 * every print, and a reprint arrives with no tender of its own — so the first
 * reprint erased the record and then rendered without it.
 *
 * The fix reads the stored value back when the caller supplies none. Nothing
 * was missing from the schema; the bug was that we were deleting it.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * Each case is asserted on the RENDERED HTML, not on the argument passed
 * inward, because the defect was a value that survived one call and not the
 * next — an assertion on the call would have passed throughout.
 *
 * The "no stored tender" case is the one that stops the fix over-reaching: a
 * card sale, a credit sale and a restaurant bill have nothing stored, and must
 * still render exactly as before. And the "supplied wins" case pins the
 * precedence, because a reprint reading a stale tender over a fresh one would
 * be the same class of bug pointing the other way.

 * The positive case asserts the bytes arrive as a `data:` URI, not merely that

 * is an image" and is exactly the bug this fixes on the A4 side: the tag is
 * there, the picture is not, because the path resolves against the web app.
 *
 * The negative case is the one that stops the fix over-reaching. Every tenant
 * without a logo — which is every tenant until someone uploads one — must print
 * precisely what it printed before, so "no logo configured" asserts no `<img>`
 * at all AND that the shop name is still there.
 *
 * The name is asserted in BOTH cases. A logo that replaced the shop name would
 * pass a test that only looked for the image, and a bill whose branding failed
 * to render would then carry nothing identifying the shop at all.
