/**
 * Inventory tracking switched off — the right provider for a restaurant selling
 * from a menu, where "how many chicken curries are left" is not a stock question.
 *
 * ## What it does, precisely
 *
 * Every mutator is a **deterministic no-op**: it touches no row, throws nothing,
 * and returns the same way for the same input every time. It takes the `tx`
 * parameter and ignores it, which is intentional — the signature is part of the
 * port contract, and a caller inside a transaction must be able to call this
 * without a special case.
 *
 * `getAvailability` is **explicit rather than silent**: it reports every requested
 * product as `isUnlimited: true` with `quantityOnHand: null`. Returning zero would
 * make callers refuse sales; returning an empty map would make them think the
 * products do not exist. `null` plus `isUnlimited` says "there is no ceiling and I
 * have no number", which is the truth.
 *
 * ## What it must never do
 *
 * - **No `SyncJob` or `SyncLog` rows.** It never touches the outbox at all.
 * - **No QuickBooks call.** It has no QuickBooks dependency to call with — note the
 *   constructor takes nothing.
 * - **Never behave like `LocalInventoryProvider`.** It does not read or write
 *   `Product.quantityOnHand`. A tenant that switched inventory off must not have
 *   stock quietly moving underneath it, and a bug that routed a QuickBooks tenant
 *   here must fail visibly (sales stop being constrained) rather than silently
 *   half-work.
 *
 * It holds no `PrismaService` at all, which is the structural guarantee behind all
 * three of those promises: it has no way to write a row.
