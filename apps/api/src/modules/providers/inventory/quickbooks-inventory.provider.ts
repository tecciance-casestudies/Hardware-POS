/**
 * QuickBooks-mastered inventory — today's production behaviour, unchanged.
 *
 * ## Why this looks so much like the local provider
 *
 * Because that is what the code does today, and Slice 5 adapts rather than
 * redesigns. QuickBooks Online is the authority for stock, but the POS keeps a
 * **cached** `Product.quantityOnHand` so checkout is fast and works during a
 * QuickBooks outage. A sale decrements the cache locally and inside the sale
 * transaction; QuickBooks reduces the real quantity later as a side effect of the
 * Sales Receipt or Invoice the outbox pushes; the periodic product pull reconciles
 * the cache back to QuickBooks' absolute numbers.
 *
 * So the local write is not a duplicate of the QuickBooks write — it is a cache
 * update, and it is the reason overselling is impossible even while offline.
 *
 * The crucial difference from `LocalInventoryProvider` is what is **absent**: no
 * multi-branch guard. The number here is a cache of an upstream total, not a claim
 * about branch-level stock, so a multi-branch QuickBooks tenant is exactly as
 * correct (and exactly as approximate) as it is today. Adding a guard would break
 * every existing multi-branch tenant, which is precisely the outcome Phase 1
 * forbids.
 *
 * ## No QuickBooks types cross the port
 *
 * This class talks to `SyncQueueService` and Prisma only. It imports nothing from
 * the QuickBooks client, and no Intuit type appears in any signature — the port
 * stays clean even though this implementation is the QuickBooks one.
