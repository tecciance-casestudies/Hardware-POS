/**
 * Where stock lives and who is authoritative for it.
 *
 * ## Scope
 *
 * Every method here exists because the current code already does it. Nothing is
 * modelled speculatively:
 *
 * | Method | Existing behaviour it abstracts |
 * |---|---|
 * | `getAvailability` | `sales.service.computeCart` reads `product.quantityOnHand` and rejects a line that exceeds it |
 * | `reduceStock` | `sales.repository.decrementStock` — the conditional `updateMany` inside the sale transaction |
 * | `restoreStock` | `returns.repository` — the eager `increment` for GOOD / RETURN_TO_STOCK items |
 * | `adjustStock` | the bulk product import writes on-hand quantities today; Slice 6 routes that through here |
 * | `synchronize` | `POST /v1/sync/products/refresh` and `POST /v1/products/sync/mock` pull products from QuickBooks |
 *
 * Deliberately **absent**: `reserveStock`. There is no reservation anywhere in the
 * repository — no held-stock column, no reservation table, no expiry. Adding it
 * would be a speculative interface for a feature that does not exist.
 *
 * ## Transaction contract — the highest-risk detail of the whole refactor
 *
 * Every mutating method takes the caller's `Prisma.TransactionClient` as its first
 * parameter and **must** perform all its writes through it.
 *
 * An implementation must never call `prisma.$transaction(...)` or reach for the
 * root `PrismaService`. Today's `decrementStock` guards against overselling with a
 * conditional `updateMany({ where: { quantityOnHand: { gte: qty } } })` and a
 * row-count check: a zero-row update throws and the **entire sale** rolls back. A
 * provider that opened its own connection would commit the stock movement
 * independently of the sale, so overselling becomes possible again and the
 * transactional outbox stops being an outbox.
 *
 * The caller owns transaction boundaries. A provider failure must therefore
 * propagate, so it participates in the caller's rollback.
 *
 * ## Tenant safety
 *
 * `ctx.tenantId` always comes from the authenticated server-side context; no
 * implementation may read a tenant id from a request. Every product write is
 * additionally scoped by `tenantId` in its `where` clause, so a product id
 * belonging to another tenant matches zero rows rather than being mutated.

   * upstream quantity with no variant dimension, and `NoInventoryProvider` has no
   * quantities at all; forcing either to implement this would mean inventing an
   * answer. A caller that finds the method absent keeps the product-level check,
   * which is the correct behaviour for both.
   *
   * Read-only, so no transaction client — the same contract as
   * {@link getAvailability}. It remains a courtesy check: `reduceStock`'s
   * conditional write is still the authority under concurrency.

   *
   * Supply it to have the provider append a `StockMovement` for each line it
   * actually moved. **Omitting it means "I keep my own ledger"** — a real state,
   * not a forgotten argument: `RoundDepletionService` writes its own
   * `ORDER_ROUND` rows in the caller and must not get a duplicate from here.
   *
   * Optional for exactly that reason. Making it required would change the call
   * shape of the restaurant path, whose behaviour is deliberately untouched.
   *
   * Only `LocalInventoryProvider` writes movements. QuickBooks stock is a cache
   * of an upstream system whose ledger is not ours to write, and

   *
   *  1. upserting the branch's `BranchInventory` cell for each line —
   *     `quantityOnHand += quantityReceived`, `averageCost` recomputed from the
   *     pre-receipt balance and the received unitCost (weighted average),
   *  2. appending a `StockMovement` per line with `reason: RECEIPT`,
   *     `refType: 'INVENTORY_RECEIPT_LINE'`, `refId: line.receiptLineId`,
   *     `unitCost: line.unitCost`,
   *  3. for `LOCAL` inventory (single-branch tenants only, per the class
   *     comment), keeping `Product.quantityOnHand` in sync as the legacy

   *
   * Returned outcomes are per line, in input order, and carry the post-receipt
   * balance + weighted-average snapshot for that (branch, product, variant?)
   * cell — the caller uses them to refresh the mirror on
   * `ProductVariant.averageCost` (or `Product.averageCost` for a legacy
   * variant-less line) and to compose the receipt response.
   *
   * Providers that cannot receive stock (QuickBooks — stock is owned upstream;
   * NONE — stock tracking is off) **must throw**
   * `ProviderOperationUnavailableError`. A silent no-op would look like a
   * successful receive that never moved stock, so the receipt would live in the
