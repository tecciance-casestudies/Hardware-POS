/**
 * Local stock, with AxloPOS as the authority and no external system involved.
 *
 * ## The multi-branch guard — the important part of this class
 *
 * `Product.quantityOnHand` is **one global number per product**, with no branch
 * dimension. For a single-branch tenant that column is a complete and correct
 * description of stock. For a multi-branch tenant it is not: reducing it for a sale
 * at branch A silently reduces the number branch B is also reading.
 *
 * `BranchInventory` **does** exist (D44) and is branch- and variant-scoped — this
 * comment claimed otherwise until D120 corrected it. But only receipts and variant
 * sales write it; a product-level sale still moves the global column, so the guard
 * below remains necessary. D10's Phase 2.5, which would move *every* path onto
 * branch-scoped rows, is still outstanding.
 *
 * So this provider **counts the tenant's active branches and refuses** when there
 * is more than one. That is a deliberate choice to fail loudly rather than to
 * quietly serve wrong numbers: a POS that lets you oversell, or that hides stock
 * that exists, is worse than one that tells you the configuration is unsupported.
 *
 * The guard runs on every operation rather than being cached, because a tenant can
 * open a second branch at any moment and the answer must not be stale — the same
 * reasoning as decision D11 for the business profile.
 *
 * QuickBooks-mastered tenants are unaffected: they use
 * `QuickBooksInventoryProvider`, where the same column is a *cache* of an
 * authoritative upstream quantity rather than the source of truth.
 *
 * ## Transactions
 *
 * Every mutator writes exclusively through the `tx` it is given. The branch-count
 * read also uses `tx` where one is available, so it sees the same snapshot as the
 * write it is guarding.

   *
   *  - **A variant line** is answered by the `(branch, variant)` `BranchInventory`
   *    cell. Missing cell means zero on that shelf, and the count creates it.
   *  - **A product-level line** is answered by `Product.quantityOnHand`, which is
   *    what `reduceStock` guards for a variant-less sale. That column has no
   *    branch dimension, so this path takes the same multi-branch refusal the
   *    sale path takes — setting one global number from one branch's shelf would
   *    quietly destroy another branch's stock. The `BranchInventory` cell is
   *    written too, so both readers agree afterwards.
   *
   * ## Setting, not decrementing
   *
   * `quantityOnHand: counted`. No `gte` predicate, no row-count check, no
   * refusal for going down: the shelf is the authority and the books are what is
   * wrong. This is the whole point of D132, and it is why the count does not
   * reuse `reduceStock` — whose conditional write exists to lose a race safely,
   * a property a count must not have.
   *
   * A movement is written for every line that actually changed. A line counted
   * at exactly what the books said is not a movement, and recording it as one
   * would fill the ledger with zero-delta rows that say nothing.
