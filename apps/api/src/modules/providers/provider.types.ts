 *    class-validator decorators. Passing one into a provider would couple a
 *    domain port to the wire format and drag validation metadata into the
 *    inventory layer.
 *
 * Quantities are plain `number`, matching the existing convention rather than
 * inventing a new one: the Prisma columns are `Decimal(12,3)`, and the current
 * code reads them with `Number(product.quantityOnHand)`, computes in `number`
 * (see `ComputedLine.quantity`), and lets Prisma widen back to Decimal on write.
 * Using `Prisma.Decimal` in the port would diverge from every existing call site
 * Slice 6 has to adopt.
