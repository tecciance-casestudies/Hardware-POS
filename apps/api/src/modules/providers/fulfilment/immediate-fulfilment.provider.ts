/**
 * D61 — immediate fulfilment: the counter sale.
 *
 * Deliberately thin, and honestly so. A counter sale has no persisted work
 * unit — the priced cart in the request IS the work unit (plan §3.3 rejected
 * inventing an order row for it), so collection is a pass-through of the
 * cart's lines and release holds nothing to free. The class exists because
 * the kind must be total: `FULFILMENT_PROVIDERS` is a `Record<FulfilmentKind,
 * …>`, and a kind without a provider is a compile error — the same
 * no-silent-fallback rule the domain registry uses (D56).
