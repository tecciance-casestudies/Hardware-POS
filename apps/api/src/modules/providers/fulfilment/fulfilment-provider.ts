/**
 * D61 — the third provider axis (convergence plan §4.5, Phase 4), alongside
 * `InventoryProvider` and `AccountingProvider` (D28).
 *
 * A fulfilment provider owns HOW a sale comes into being — the operational
 * lifecycle between "the customer wants this" and "the money settled". The
 * settlement document itself (`Sale`/`SaleItem`, D58) is Layer-1 invariant
 * core: every provider projects into it, which is why a new vertical's
 * lifecycle (an appointment, a room-night, a repair job) inherits reporting,
 * receipts, returns and accounting without touching any of them.
 *
 * ## Why the work-unit ref is a tagged union, not an entity id
 *
 * TABLE_SERVICE has a persisted work unit (the `TableSession`); IMMEDIATE
 * deliberately has none — a counter sale's "work unit" is the priced cart in
 * the request, and inventing a row for it would make retail pay for
 * concurrency machinery it never uses (plan §3.3). The union makes both
 * shapes first-class instead of pretending one is the other. A future
 * provider adds its own variant (`{ kind: 'APPOINTMENT', appointmentId }`).
