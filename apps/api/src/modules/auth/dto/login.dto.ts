 * compatibility: an email that exists in exactly one tenant still logs in without
 * it, which is every existing client and the dev seed. It becomes *required* the
 * moment the same address exists in more than one tenant, because there is no
 * safe way to guess which one the caller meant.
 *
 * The slug is client-supplied and unverified at this point. It only ever NARROWS
 * the lookup — the password is still checked against the resolved user's own hash —
 * so an invented workspace can only make a login fail, never succeed.
