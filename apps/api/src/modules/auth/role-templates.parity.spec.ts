/**
 * Role-template and permission parity (Phase 1.5, D36/D37).
 *
 * The Product Owner required parity across four copies of the same vocabulary:
 * the code catalogue, the seeded assignments, the API's permission decorators,
 * and the frontend constants. Slice 7.3 already ended the drift between three of
 * them by making `packages/shared` the single authority; this file covers what
 * Phase 1.5 adds — role *templates*, which are a second statement of
 * `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` and could drift from it the moment someone edits one.
 *
 * ## What makes these non-vacuous
 *
 * Every set comparison is exact, never a count. Every "X is absent" is paired with
 * a positive control proving the collection being searched is populated. The
 * reserved-permission assertions matter most: they are the claim that no
 * restaurant feature is implemented, and they would pass trivially against a route
 * probe that found nothing — so the probe's own output is asserted first.
