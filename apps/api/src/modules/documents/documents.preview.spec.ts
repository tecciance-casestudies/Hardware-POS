 *
 * The change moves a hard-coded list out of this service and into the domain
 * registry. The risk that matters is not that retail fails to get its own goods
 * — that is the visible half anyone would test — it is that **hardware's
 * preview changes** while nobody is looking, because hardware belongs to
 * another team and its eight lines were relocated rather than rewritten.
 *
 * So hardware is pinned item by item, on the rendered HTML, in the same
 * expectation that proves retail differs. A test that only checked "retail sees
 * clothing" would pass just as happily with hardware's preview destroyed.
 *
 * The registry walk is an exact map over BUSINESS_TYPE_VALUES, so a business
 * type added later arrives here by name rather than silently inheriting
 * whichever list it happens to resolve to.

/**
 * D193 — the letterhead carries its pictures, it does not point at them.
 *
 * ## The defect
 *
 * Branding assets are stored as `/uploads/<key>` — a path with no origin. The
 * A4 HTML is built by the API and then written into a popup by the web app
 * (`win.document.write`), so the popup's origin is the WEB app and
 * `<img src="/uploads/…">` asks a server that has never heard of the file.
 * Proven against the running stack: the API answered that path with 302 and the
 * web app with 404, and the quotation printed a broken image where the logo
 * should be.
 *
 * ## What makes these non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * The positive case asserts a `data:` URI AND the absence of any `/uploads/`
 * src. Asserting only that an `<img>` is present would pass against the broken
 * version, which emitted one all along — the tag was never the problem.
 *
 * All three assets are asserted, because they are three separate fields that
 * were each emitted raw: a fix that inlined the logo and left the signature and
 * stamp pointing at the API would print a letterhead with one picture and two
 * broken icons, and a logo-only test would call that a pass.
