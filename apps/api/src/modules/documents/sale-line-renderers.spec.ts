/**
 * D120 (2.12) — every renderer of a sold line names the variant.
 *
 * ## Why this test exists
 *
 * 1c.7 put the size on the receipt and believed the job done. It was not: a sale
 * line is rendered in FOUR places, and only two were found. The same sale then
 * printed with `M / Navy` from the server's A4 endpoint and as a bare
 * `Cotton T-Shirt` from the web app's own A4 — discovered by a person looking at
 * a customer-facing invoice, which is the expensive way to find it.
 *
 * The root defect was never the missing line. It was four copies of one rule.
 * `saleLineLabel` in `@hardware-pos/shared` is now the single authority, and
 * this spec is what stops a fifth renderer being added blind: it enumerates the
 * files that render a sold line and fails if one does not call the shared
 * formatter.
 *
 * ## Why source inspection, and how it is kept honest (D30)
 *
 * Two of the four renderers are React components in `apps/web`; this suite
 * cannot import them. So the check is textual — which is exactly the kind of
 * test D30 warns can pass while asserting nothing. Three guards:
 *
 *   1. every listed file must EXIST and be non-empty (a renamed file fails
 *      loudly rather than silently inspecting nothing);
 *   2. the positive assertion is paired with a negative — the raw field access
 *      the bug looked like must be absent;
 *   3. the formatter's own behaviour is asserted against the real function, not
 *      re-expressed here.
