/**
 * Drift guard between the persisted Prisma enums and the shared vocabulary
 * (D56 — replaces `module-key-contract.spec.ts`).
 *
 * The web client must never import the Prisma client, so it used to
 * hand-maintain string-literal unions guarded by a REGEX over the web file's
 * source text — a guard that broke twice during D55 when a comment landed
 * inside a union. D56 moved the unions to `@hardware-pos/shared` (browser-safe
 * by design); the web imports them, and this spec compares the shared VALUES
 * against the Prisma enums at runtime. No parsing, nothing to drift out of
 * match with the file it reads.
 *
 * Both directions matter: a value added to Prisma and not to shared would hide
 * a real tenant state from every client; a value added to shared and not to
 * Prisma would let a client offer a state the API rejects.
