/**
 * What the queue reports for money owed, and what the Unpaid filter finds.
 *
 * The defect these pin: `paymentStatus` was `sale?.paymentStatus ?? null`, and
 * a Sale only exists once an order is settled. So an order that was placed,
 * cooked and handed over but never billed reported NO payment status — and the
 * Unpaid filter, an equality test against that field, could never match it
 * (`null === 'UNPAID'` is false). The one filter a manager uses to chase money
 * returned only the orders that had already been billed, and hid every table
 * still holding it.
 *
 * Every case therefore asserts the state AND its absence elsewhere: a
 * projection that stamped UNPAID on everything would pass the unbilled cases
 * alone, and one that still returned null everywhere would pass the
 * cancelled/third-party cases alone. Neither passes both.
