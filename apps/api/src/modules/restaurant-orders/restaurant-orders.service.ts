/**
 * What a restaurant order with no Sale of its own reports as its payment state.
 *
 * A Sale is only written at settlement, so an order that is placed, cooked and
 * handed over but never billed carried NO payment status at all. In the queue
 * that read as an ambiguous dash, and — the real damage — it made the Unpaid
 * filter skip exactly the orders somebody still has to chase, because that
 * filter is an equality test against this field and `null === 'UNPAID'` is
 * false. "Show me who has not paid" answered with the orders that HAD been
 * billed, and hid every table still holding the money.
 *
 * Until D137 the narrower reading — `UNPAID` only once a bill exists — lived
 * in this code alone (`sale?.paymentStatus ?? null`); the log never recorded
 * it (there is no D53 record, and D52's sentence is about the Sale row
 * legitimately existing unpaid). D137 widens it to the plain-money reading —
 * nobody has taken the money yet — because that is the question the queue's
 * Unpaid chip is actually asked. A raised-but-unpaid bill and a never-billed
 * order are both money owed on this branch tonight, and the counter chases
 * them the same way.
 *
 * CANCELLED and DRAFT stay `null`. Nothing was ever owed on an order that was
 * called off or never submitted, so badging them Unpaid would park permanent
 * false debt in the queue. `null` keeps its honest meaning of "no payment
 * state of ours applies" — which is also what a third-party row returns, since
 * that money is the platform's to collect and was never ours to report.
