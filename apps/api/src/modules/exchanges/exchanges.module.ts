 * D128 — the exchange module imports the two it composes and adds nothing else.
 *
 * No `ProvidersModule`, no `SyncModule`, no `SettingsModule`: this module
 * resolves no provider, enqueues no sync and reads no setting. Everything that
 * needs them is reached through `ReturnsService` and `SalesService`, which
 * already own those relationships. Importing them here would be the beginning of
 * a second money path, which is the one thing the record forbids.
