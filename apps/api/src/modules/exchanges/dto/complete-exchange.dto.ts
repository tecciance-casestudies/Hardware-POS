/**
 * D128 — complete an exchange: return one variant, issue another, settle the
 * difference.
 *
 * The line DTOs are **imported, not redefined**. A returned line is exactly a
 * return line and a replacement line is exactly a sale line; restating either
 * shape here would be a second copy that drifts the first time one of them gains
 * a field — the `4.15` / `4.21` failure in a different costume.
 *
 * **Settlement is gross, not netted** (D128a). The return refunds the goods
 * coming back and the replacement is paid for in full, so `payments` must cover
 * the whole replacement value. For an even swap the customer hands over what
 * they are handed back and the drawer nets to zero.
 *
 * D128 originally netted through `STORE_CREDIT`. That cannot work at a counter:
 * `ReturnsService` refuses a store-credit refund unless the sale has a saved,
 * non-walk-in customer — correctly, because store credit is a liability held
 * against an account — and a clothing shop swapping a size is almost always a
 * walk-in. Gross settlement needs no change to any existing money path.
