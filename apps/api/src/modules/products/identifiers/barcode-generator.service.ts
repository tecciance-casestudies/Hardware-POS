 * ## The sequencing constraint is enforced, not documented
 *
 * D125 adopts as binding: the prefix map must be configured BEFORE any
 * allocation, or the tenant reprints every label. So allocation REFUSES while
 * `catalogue.barcodePrefix` is null. A default prefix would be the failure the
 * constraint exists to prevent — silently committing a shop to a number nobody
 * chose, discovered only once the labels are printed.
 *
 * ## Every generated code carries a correct check digit
 *
 * That is the entire point. The pilot database holds 18 barcodes that do not,
 * from two generators neither of which computed one, and they would have failed
 * at `5.7` looking like a rendering bug.
 *
 * ## A supplier barcode is never overwritten
 *
 * `barcodeSource` answers the only question the system asks: may I regenerate
 * this? SUPPLIER means no. NULL means unknown, and unknown is also treated as
 * no — the twenty pilot codes predate the flag, and guessing would authorise
 * destroying a manufacturer's code.
