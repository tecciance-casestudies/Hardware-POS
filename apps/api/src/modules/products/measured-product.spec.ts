/**
 * D134c (`6.1`) — a measured product must name its unit.
 *
 * ## Why this is a unit spec and not only an integration one
 *
 * The rule is a pure function of two values, and it has four cases that matter.
 * Exercising them through `ProductsService.update` would need a database, a
 * tenant and a stored product for each — four fixtures to prove one conditional.
 * The integration spec covers that the SERVICE calls it with the resulting
 * state; this covers the rule itself, exhaustively.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * The rule is asserted in **both directions**. A test that only checked the
 * refusal would pass for an implementation that refused everything — including
 * every shirt in every tenant, which is exactly the failure mode a `NOT NULL`
 * column would have had. So the positive case, "a WHOLE product needs no unit",
 * carries as much weight here as the negative one.
