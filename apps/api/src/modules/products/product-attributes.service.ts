   * D134e — refuse a measured product from a domain that does not sell by
   * measure. RETAIL declares `catalogue.measuredGoods`; hardware, food

   *
   * Here for the reason this whole class exists: `ProductsService` may not
   * reference `BusinessProfileService` (D28, and a tripwire enforces it), and
   * this is domain DATA validation rather than provider routing — the same
   * shape as the attribute check below. The class name lags what it now
   * holds; it is the products module's domain-rule resolver.
   *
   * ## Why this checks the INCOMING value, not the resulting state
   *
   * D134c's unit check reads the resulting state, because leaving a product
   * measured-with-no-unit is invalid however you arrive there. This one is
   * the opposite: it must not brick a row that already exists. A hardware
   * tenant that acquired a DECIMAL product before this guard — the pilot has
   * a real one — must still be able to rename it, reprice it, and above all
   * switch it back to WHOLE. Reading the resulting state would refuse every
   * edit to that row, including the edit that fixes it.
   *
   * So the rule is “you may not ASSERT measured here”, not “no measured row
   * may exist here”. Frontend hiding is usability; this is the authority.
