/**
 * `reopenTicket` — D100's recall verb, the inverse of the bump.
 *
 * What is worth pinning:
 *
 * - Recalling a COMPLETED ticket rewrites it to QUEUED and CLEARS the
 *   completion record (completedAt + completedByUserId), because a recalled
 *   ticket is work to do again and a stale "done by" name says otherwise.
 * - Recalling a ticket that was never completed writes nothing — the
 *   idempotency mirror of completeTicket, for the same double-tap reason.
 * - A ticket outside the tenant/branch is a KitchenTicketNotFoundError, not
 *   a cross-tenant write.
 *
 * Prisma is a stub; assertions are about the write the service issues, not
 * the database.
