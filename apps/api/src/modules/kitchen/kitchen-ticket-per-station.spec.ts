/**
 * D152 — a round is ONE TICKET PER STATION again, and NOTHING IS DROPPED.
 *
 * This file was `kitchen-ticket-per-round.spec.ts` and asserted the exact
 * opposite: D147 had collapsed a round to a single stationless ticket. It is
 * rewritten rather than deleted (D16) because its most valuable test survives
 * INVERTED — a round whose items span two stations must now yield TWO tickets
 * carrying the right items each, where it used to prove one carrying all.
 *
 * Two claims, and the second is the one with money attached:
 *
 * - A round produces one ticket per station its items route to, each holding
 *   only that station's lines and each with its own KOT number.
 * - An item with NO station link reaches the branch's MAIN station. It is not
 *   dropped, and it is not guessed at. The pre-D147 routing sent unlinked
 *   items to the sole active station when the branch had exactly one and
 *   DISCARDED them otherwise (D67); the affected branch has four, so an
 *   unlinked dish reached the board on NO ticket at all — ordered, billed,
 *   never cooked. That is what D152's Main fallback exists to end, and the
 *   mutation proof at the bottom shows this file rejects the drop's return.
 *
 * The fixture is deliberately hostile to both claims. Its branch has FOUR
 * ordinary stations plus Main, so "the unlinked item was routed" can never be
 * an artefact of D67's single-station fallback; its round spans three of them
 * plus one unlinked line plus one legacy MENU_ITEM line; and both link stubs
 * FILTER on the ids they are asked for, so a routing lookup that widened its
 * `where` would pull in the decoy link the D60 test relies on and fail.
 *
 * Prisma is a stub: the assertions are about the WRITES the service issues.
 * What the database does with them is pinned by the integration suite.
