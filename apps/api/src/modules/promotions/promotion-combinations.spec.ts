/**
 * D126 — all four promotion types in one basket, in every combination.
 *
 * ## What this exists for
 *
 * The reported defect was "one promotion removes another". 4.20 fixed the
 * mechanism; this spec is the standing proof that it stays fixed as the engine
 * grows, and it is written as an exhaustive matrix rather than a handful of
 * examples because the failure mode is a PARTICULAR PAIR interacting badly. A
 * suite of individually-tested promotions cannot see that.
 *
 * All 15 non-empty subsets of {Bundle, BOGO, Percentage, cart-level AmountOff}
 * are enumerated and asserted. The four-way case — the one that matters most to
 * the operator — is not a special test; it falls out of the same table, so it
 * cannot be quietly weakened while the others stay green.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * Each combination is asserted against the SUM OF ITS PARTS, measured
 * individually in the same run. That is a much stronger claim than "some
 * discount happened": it fails if a promotion is dropped, if one is applied
 * twice, and if two are applied to the same line.
 *
 * The exact set of applied promotion ids is asserted too, not just the money, so
 * a combination that reached the right total by the wrong route still fails.
 *
 * Every promotion covers DISTINCT products, deliberately. Overlap is tested in
 * `applier.spec.ts`; mixing the two questions in one table would make a failure
 * ambiguous between "stacking broke" and "overlap resolution changed".
 *
 * The non-stackable rows are the counterweight: without them the whole matrix
 * would pass for an engine that ignored `stackable` and applied everything
 * always, which is exactly what the brief said not to build.
