/**
 * D56 — a promotion may only be scoped to a channel its tenant sells on.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `VALID_CHANNELS` was the constant `['DINE_IN','TAKEAWAY','ONLINE']`. Step 4.9
 * taught the editor to offer `capabilities.fulfilment.channels`, so a retail
 * shopkeeper was correctly shown a single **Counter** chip — and the server then
 * refused the only chip on screen with
 * `Unknown channel 'COUNTER'; expected one of DINE_IN, TAKEAWAY, ONLINE.`
 * A retail promotion with any channel scope was unsaveable, on every promotion
 * type. Half the fix shipped; this is the other half.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * The two templates are asserted AGAINST EACH OTHER: retail accepts COUNTER and
 * rejects DINE_IN, food service does exactly the reverse. Either direction alone
 * would pass for a service that accepted every channel from everyone — which is
 * the obvious wrong fix (widening the constant to four values) and is what these
 * tests exist to rule out.
 *
 * The restaurant case is a regression guard, not a new requirement: its allowed
 * set is byte-identical to the deleted constant.
 *
 * MUTATION PROOF (D30 §5) — replacing the capability read with the obvious wrong
 * fix, a widened constant `['COUNTER','DINE_IN','TAKEAWAY','ONLINE']`:
 *
 *   ✗ RETAIL refuses a food-service channel
 *   ✗ FOOD SERVICE keeps its three, and is not handed COUNTER
 *   ✗ names the tenant's own channels in the error, not a fixed list
 *   ✗ PATCH is validated too, not just create
 *   ✓ RETAIL saves a COUNTER-scoped promotion            (agrees either way)
 *   ✓ an empty scope ... never consults the profile      (agrees either way)
 *
 * Four of six fail; the two that pass are the cases where a widened list and the
 * capability genuinely agree. Widening the constant would have made the reported
 * bug go away while quietly letting a restaurant scope a promotion to a retail
 * counter, so this is the mutation worth proving against.

/**
 * A time window must be able to contain a moment.
 *
 * ## What was wrong
 *
 * `isPromotionActive` reads `startTime`/`endTime` as the half-open interval
 * [start, end) and has no overnight wrap, but the only validation was
 * "both or neither". So two shapes saved cleanly and produced a promotion that
 * is switched on, reads Active in the list, and can never fire on any day:
 * `start === end`, and `start > end` — the latter being exactly what an operator
 * writes meaning "18:00 through 09:00".
 *
 * Reported from the field as a bundle that stopped discounting. The window was
 * 12:56–12:57: a one-minute schedule nobody typed, because Chrome's native
 * `<input type="time">` inserts the current clock time when its icon is clicked.
 * That one is legal and stays legal — a flash sale is a real thing to want — and
 * is warned about in the editor rather than refused here.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * Every rejected window is paired with an accepted one, in the same suite. A
 * guard that threw on all four would pass every rejection test while making the
 * ordinary 09:00–17:00 promotion — and the all-day blank pair, which is most of
 * them — unsaveable. The one-minute window is asserted to SAVE, which is the
 * assertion that fails if anyone tightens this guard into a duration rule.
 *
 * MUTATION PROOF (D30 §5) — three mutations, each actually run:
 *
 *   A. Guard removed entirely (the defect as shipped):
 *        × refuses an empty interval
 *        × refuses a window that would have to cross midnight
 *        × guards PATCH as well as create
 *      3 of 6 fail; the accepted-window cases correctly still pass.
 *
 *   B. `>` instead of `>=` — the off-by-one that lets equal times through:
 *        × refuses an empty interval
 *      1 of 6. That single test is the only thing standing between an operator
 *      and a promotion scheduled 12:56–12:56, which is why it is its own case
 *      rather than folded into the midnight test.
 *
 *   C. Over-tightened into a minimum duration (`end - start < 15`) — the
 *      tempting over-correction, since a one-minute window is what was reported:
 *        × still SAVES a one-minute window — legal, merely unusual
 *      1 of 6. This is the direction the fix is most likely to drift, and the
 *      only test that catches it is the one asserting a permission rather than
 *      a refusal.
