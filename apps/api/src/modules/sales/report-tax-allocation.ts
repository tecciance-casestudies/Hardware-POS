/**
 * `8.4` — split one sale's recorded tax across the rates its lines were charged
 * at, in `Prisma.Decimal`.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * **`SaleItem.taxAmount` is always `0`.** `sales.service` writes it that way on
 * purpose — "splitting the order-level tax across lines is per-line COMPUTATION,
 * which is parked with grocery (D122)". Tax is computed once for the whole sale
 * and lives on `Sale.taxAmount`; the line carries only the RATE it was charged
 * at (`taxRatePercent`, frozen by D122).
 *
 * Verified on the pilot database rather than inferred from the comment: 43 sale
 * lines, none with a non-zero `taxAmount`, while 12 of 20 completed sales carry
 * tax. Any report that sums `SaleItem.taxAmount` therefore reads `0.00` for
 * every real sale — which is exactly what `8.3` shipped before this file
 * existed, and why the fix landed with it.
 *
 * ## Why not call `taxBreakdownForDocument`
 *
 * That helper implements this same weighting for a printed document, and the
 * arithmetic below is deliberately its twin — a parity test in
 * `report-tax-allocation.spec.ts` runs both over the same inputs and fails if
 * they ever diverge. It is not called directly for two reasons:
 *
 *  1. It returns `[]` when every line shares one rate, so a document does not
 *     print a breakdown that merely repeats the total it already printed. A
 *     PERIOD report is the opposite case: a single-rate shop reconciling its
 *     tax return needs that one row more than anyone.
 *  2. It works in `number`. A document allocates one sale's tax and prints it;
 *     a report adds thousands of those together, which is where float error
 *     accumulates — the shape audit item A8 describes (D129, D59).
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 *     taxable_i = lineTotal_i − (orderDiscount × lineTotal_i / discountedSubtotal)
 *     weight_i  = taxable_i × ratePercent_i
 *     tax_i     = recordedTax × weight_i / Σweight
 *
 * `taxable_i` is line net less its proportional share of the order discount —
 * the same quantity `computeReturnLine` derives, so a printed document, a later
 * refund and this report all divide the recorded tax identically.
 *
 * The cart-level promotion (`Sale.promotionOrderDiscountAmount`) is deliberately
 * NOT subtracted: D126 applies it after tax, so it never entered the taxable
 * base and must not be removed from it here either.
