 * Phase 8 retail reporting.
 *
 * ## Money never becomes a number here (D129)
 *
 * Every figure is `Prisma.Decimal` from the column to the response, and is
 * emitted with `Decimal.toFixed()`. Nothing is accumulated in JavaScript. That is
 * not stylistic: audit item **A8** is exactly this defect in the restaurant
 * reports, and `report-money.spec.ts` fails the branch if it reappears here.
 *
 * ## Why these load rows instead of using `groupBy`
 *
 * `8.3` originally summed `SaleItem.taxAmount` in SQL, which was fast, elegant
 * and always `0.00`: `sales.service` writes that column as zero on purpose, tax
 * being computed once per sale and parked at line level with grocery (D122).
 * Tax has to be allocated down from `Sale.taxAmount` before it can be grouped by
 * anything, and an allocation is per-sale arithmetic that SQL aggregation cannot
 * express. The rows are therefore loaded and folded in `Decimal`.
 *
 * The cost is real and bounded: one query per report over one date range,
 * selecting seven columns. For the ranges a shop reports on — a day, a week, a
 * month — that is thousands of rows, not millions. A shop large enough to feel
 * it needs a materialised daily rollup, which is a different piece of work.
 *
 * ## What counts as a sale
 *
 * `status: COMPLETED` and `completedAt` inside the range. A draft is not a sale,
 * and a sale's date is when it was completed rather than when it was started —
 * a basket held overnight (`8.8`) belongs to the day it was paid for.
 *
 * Returns are deliberately NOT netted off. "Which sizes sold this month" is a
 * question about what left the shelf; a manager reconciling refunds asks a
 * different question, and answering both in one column would make neither
 * legible. Returns have their own history.
