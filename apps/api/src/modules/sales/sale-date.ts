/**
 * Resolution of the user-chosen invoice date for a POS sale ("backdating").
 *
 * The POS sends a plain calendar date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) — the day the sale actually
 * happened. That day is anchored in the SHOP's timezone: not the server's, which
 * is an accident of deployment, and not the cashier's, because the invoice the
 * date ends up on is itself rendered in the shop's zone. Anchoring it anywhere
 * else would let a sale picked as "1 Aug" print as "31 Jul" on the very document
 * the date exists to state.
 *
 * The stored instant is midday in that zone rather than midnight: midday is the
 * furthest point from a date boundary, so no DST shift or offset rounding can
 * push the sale onto a neighbouring day. Only a genuine BACKDATE takes this path
 * — a sale left on today's date sends no `saleDate` at all and keeps its real
 * instant — so the conventional 12:00 appears exactly where the true time of day
 * is unknown, rather than inventing a plausible-looking one.
 *
 * Forward dating is rejected — a sale may be dated today or earlier, "today"
 * being the shop's current day.
