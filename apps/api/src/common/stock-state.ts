/**
 * Roll a product's variant stock up into the single figure its card shows.
 *
 * ## Why this exists (D120, 1c.6)
 *
 * Stock is tracked by **variant**, not by product. `Product.quantityOnHand` is a
 * legacy rollup *mirror* (D10) — maintained on sale and receipt, but a mirror, and
 * a mirror can drift. One out-of-band write is enough: a product read 350 while its
 * four sizes held 22 between them, and the till advertised the 350.
 *
 * So a product with variants derives its figure from the rows that are actually
 * authoritative, and the mirror is not consulted.
 *
 * Deriving here rather than in the till is deliberate. D31 makes the server the
 * authority; the alternative was the same aggregation in `pos-retail-checkout` and
 * again in `quotation-builder`, which is two copies of one rule and therefore an
 * eventual disagreement between two screens.
 *
 * ## The rules
 *
 * - **Quantity** is the sum across sizes. Unlike price, a total is informative
 *   rather than misleading: nothing caps a sale by it (the till caps per variant),
 *   and "22 brushes across 4 sizes" is a true and useful thing for a cashier.
 * - **`OUT` only when every size is out.** A shirt with no Mediums is still a
 *   sellable shirt, and greying the card would hide the Larges.
 * - **`LOW` when no size is `IN_STOCK`** but something remains — every size is at
 *   or below its own reorder point.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `UNTRACKED` case. `stockStateFor` cannot return it, and
 * the caller only reaches this helper inside its `tracksStock` branch — a tenant
 * that tracks no stock is answered before any variant is consulted. An
 * `every(s === 'UNTRACKED')` guard here was unreachable, and the test written for
 * it asserted `OUT` while claiming to cover `UNTRACKED`: a vacuous test of the
 * exact kind D30 exists to prevent. Both are gone.
