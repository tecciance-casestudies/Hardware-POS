/**
 * D193 — turn a stored image into a `data:` URI so a document carries its own
 * pictures.
 *
 * ## Why a document cannot use a URL
 *
 * Branding assets are stored as `/uploads/<key>` — a path with no origin,
 * deliberately, so switching storage backends does not invalidate existing
 * rows. That path is fine in the app's own pages, where the browser is already
 * talking to the API.
 *
 * It is wrong in a DOCUMENT. The A4 HTML is built by the API and then written
 * into a popup by the web app:
 *
 *     win.document.write(html)     // origin: the WEB app, :3000
 *
 * so `<img src="/uploads/…">` asks **the web app** for the file, and the web app
 * has never heard of it. The image 404s and the letterhead prints with a broken
 * icon where the logo should be. The same HTML written into the receipt iframe
 * has the same problem for the same reason.
 *
 * Absolutising the URL against the API's origin would fix the popup and nothing
 * else. A quotation is **shared** — printed to PDF, attached to an email, sent
 * over WhatsApp — and a recipient's browser resolving `http://localhost:4000`
 * finds their own machine. A document that depends on the issuing server still
 * being reachable is not a document; it is a screen.
 *
 * So the bytes travel with it. Inlined, the file prints, saves, forwards and
 * opens on a machine that has never heard of this installation.
 *
 * ## Why this never throws
 *
 * A missing or unreadable logo must not turn a quotation into a 500. Every
 * failure path returns `null`, which the templates already render as "no image"
 * — the behaviour before any logo was uploaded. A branding asset is decoration;
 * the document is the point.
