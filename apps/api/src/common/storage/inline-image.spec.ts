/**
 * D193 — `inlineImage`, the piece both the A4 letterhead and the thermal bill
 * depend on.
 *
 * ## What makes these non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * Every case asserts the RETURNED VALUE's shape, not that the storage provider
 * was called. An implementation that resolved the path and then dropped the
 * bytes would satisfy "resolve was called" and produce exactly the broken image
 * this function exists to prevent.
 *
 * Both provider shapes are covered, positively. `local` hands back a file path
 * and `s3` a signed URL, and this installation runs `s3` — so a function tested
 * only against `file` would be tested against the branch nobody uses.
 *
 * The failure cases are asserted to return `null` rather than to throw, and
 * that is the point of them: a branding asset is decoration, and a quotation
 * that 500s because a logo moved is a worse outcome than one that prints
 * without it.
