  // loud, and order numbers don't collide with sale numbers.
  | 'TABLE_SESSION'
  | 'RESTAURANT_ORDER'
  // D176 — kitchen tickets get their own counter. Until now a KOT drew from
  // RESTAURANT_ORDER, so orders and tickets interleaved on one stream: 13
  // orders and 17 tickets reached RO-000029 and KOT-000030, neither series
  // contiguous, and adjacent digits across the two meant nothing. Its own
  // sequence lets the pass read "KOT-31, 32, 33" as three consecutive tickets.
  | 'KITCHEN_TICKET'
  // D44 — Purchase Receipts (Receive Stock / GRN). Kept as its own tenant
  // sequence so the "RCV-000042" identifiers do not collide with sales,
  // returns or quotations, and so gaps caused by aborted transactions are
  // impossible on the same guarantees as every other document type.
  | 'RECEIPT'
  // D47 — table reservations ("Reservation RSV-000047" over the phone).
  | 'RESERVATION'
  // D49 — auto-assigned codes for open tables ("OPEN-3" on the floor).
  | 'OPEN_TABLE'
  // D125 (Phase 5, 5.3) — per-tenant SKU numbering. Reuses this mechanism
  // rather than inventing a second one: it is already the repository's proven
  // answer to concurrent allocation. Gaps are accepted — a rolled-back product
  // creation burns a number, and a SKU is an identifier, not an audit trail.
  | 'SKU'
  // D125 Part 3 (Phase 5, 5.5) — per-tenant in-store EAN-13 numbering. Its own
  // sequence, not shared with SKU: the two are different identifiers with
  // different widths, and a shared counter would waste barcode range every time
  // a SKU was allocated.
  | 'BARCODE'
  // D128 (Phase 7, 7.1a) — exchange numbering, `X-000042`, matching `R-` and
  // `S-`. Its own sequence so an exchange number never collides with the sale
  // or return it links.
  | 'EXCHANGE'
  // D132 (Phase 8, `8.7`) — stock counts, `SC-000042`. Its own sequence for
  // the same reason as every other: a count number is quoted out loud on the
  // floor ("the variance on SC-12") and must not collide with a receipt.
  | 'STOCK_TAKE';
