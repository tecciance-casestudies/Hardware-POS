/**
 * D163 — a retail workspace's Settings: thermal bill, A4 quotations.
 *
 * ## Why a separate file from `settings-presentation.render.test.tsx`
 *
 * That spec's profile mock is typed `'HARDWARE' | 'RESTAURANT' | null`, and its
 * cases are D96's existing behaviour, which a new feature does not get to edit
 * (D16). Retail is a third answer, so it gets its own file rather than a
 * widened union threaded through assertions that were never about it.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * The obvious wrong implementation of "retail only needs a thermal bill" is to
 * make retail behave like a restaurant. That passes any test that only checks
 * the bill arrived — and it would strip the letterhead controls off a workspace
 * that still issues quotations, which nobody would notice until somebody tried
 * to brand one.
 *
 * So every case here asserts BOTH halves against ONE render: the thermal thing
 * that must now be present, and the A4 thing that must still be. A restaurant
 * comparison runs against the same component tree, so "retail kept its A4
 * controls" cannot pass because the page ignored the resolver entirely.

/**
 * D168 — the two previews share the tab instead of stacking.
 *
 * ## The report
 *
 * D163 gave retail both previews by putting one under the other. A thermal
 * bill is a metre of paper, so reaching the quotation meant scrolling past a
 * whole receipt and neither document could be seen whole.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * "Not stacked" is a claim about what is VISIBLE, and the panel that is hidden
 * is still in the DOM — deliberately, so the A4 chooser keeps its selection.
 * So `getByText`/`getByTitle` cannot state it: they find hidden nodes and would
 * pass just as happily against the stacked layout this replaces.
 *
 * `getByRole` omits `hidden` subtrees, and its singular form throws on more
 * than one match. `screen.getByRole('tabpanel')` therefore asserts EXACTLY ONE
 * visible panel, and fails against the old layout for the right reason. Every
 * case below reads through it, and pairs the document that must be on screen
 * with the one that must not.
 *
 * The last two cases are the isolation halves: hardware and restaurant preview
 * one document each and must gain no toggle at all. Each asserts the preview
 * they DO have, so "no tabs" cannot pass because the page rendered nothing.
