/**
 * 3.15 — the tenant-wide tax rate is reachable from Settings.
 *
 * ## Why this test exists
 *
 * Phase 3 gave every product a Taxable switch (3.13) and made that switch bite
 * on both the server and the till (3.10, 3.14) — but `taxRatePercent` itself was
 * writable only through `PUT /v1/settings`. An owner could zero-rate one shirt
 * and never set the rate everything else was charged at. Found by the operator,
 * not by a test, which is the third time on this branch.
 *
 * ## What makes each assertion non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * "The rate is absent for a user without the permission" would pass for a page
 * that rendered nothing at all, so that case also asserts the refusal copy IS
 * on screen and pairs with a permitted render that finds the field enabled.
 *
 * The save assertion inspects the PUT BODY rather than trusting that a click
 * happened. A test that only asserted `updateSettings` was called would pass for
 * a page that dropped the rate on the floor and sent `{ documents }` alone —
 * which is exactly what this page did before this step, and exactly the bug.
 *
 * Mutation-proven against the page itself, not a stand-in. Both mutations were
 * run and both were caught:
 *
 *   1. sending `{ documents: docs }` without `taxRatePercent` — the shape of the
 *      original defect — fails TWO cases: "sends the rate it was given" and
 *      "accepts 0", the second because the mutated page never sends 0 either.
 *   2. dropping the `!taxRateValid` guard out of `save()` fails both refusal
 *      cases (out-of-range, and an emptied box) and no others.
 *
 * Neither mutation was caught by only one assertion, and neither left the file
 * green — which is the property being claimed here.
