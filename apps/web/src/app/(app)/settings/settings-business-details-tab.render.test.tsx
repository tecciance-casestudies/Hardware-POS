/**
 * D161 — the Business details tab appears for retail, and for nobody else.
 *
 * ## Why this is a separate file from `settings-tabs.render.test.tsx`
 *
 * That spec pins the profile to `RESTAURANT` at module scope, because the tabs
 * it covers only exist for a food-service workspace. `vi.mock` is hoisted, so
 * the business type cannot be varied inside it without rewriting its harness —
 * and its assertions are existing behaviour, which a new feature does not get
 * to edit (D16). So this file mocks the same graph with a **switchable**
 * business type and asserts one thing the other cannot.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * `document-presentation.test.ts` already proves the FLAG is right for every
 * business type. That proves nothing about the screen: a page that ignored the
 * flag entirely would pass all of it. This closes the loop by rendering the
 * REAL page and looking for the real tab.
 *
 * Every case is paired. "Hardware has no Business details tab" would hold for a
 * page that rendered no tabs at all, so each case also asserts a tab that must
 * still be there — and the retail case asserts the tab IS present against the
 * same page, so neither half can pass alone.
