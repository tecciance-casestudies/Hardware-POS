/**
 * D145 — "Reset to defaults" asks before it resets, in the app's own dialog.
 *
 * ## Why this test exists
 *
 * The reset used to be guarded by `window.confirm`, which is synchronous: the
 * handler could not continue until the browser answered. The replacement is a
 * promise, so the guard is now an `await` — and an `await` that is dropped, or
 * whose result is ignored, wipes a shop's letterhead on a single stray tap with
 * nothing on screen first. That is the failure this file is here to catch.
 *
 * ## What makes each assertion non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * "Cancelling does not call the API" is also what a page with a broken button,
 * a page that never finished loading, and a page whose dialog never opened all
 * produce. So the cancel case is paired, in the same file and against the same
 * component tree, with a confirm case that asserts the API IS called and that
 * the returned defaults reach the fields — and the first case asserts the
 * dialog is on screen with `resetSettings` still uncalled, which is the exact
 * state a dropped `await` cannot reach.
 *
 * Mutation-proven against the page itself, not a stand-in. Four mutations were
 * run and all four were caught:
 *
 *   1. deleting the `if (!(await confirm(...))) return;` guard — the shape of
 *      the defect this conversion could introduce — fails all five: the reset
 *      fires on the click alone and no dialog is ever on screen.
 *   2. dropping the `!` (`if (await confirm(...)) return;`) fails the three
 *      cases that answer the question — confirming stops resetting, Cancel and
 *      Escape start — while the two that only inspect the open dialog still
 *      pass, so the polarity of the guard is proven by the answers alone.
 *   3. removing `confirmLabel: 'Reset'` fails the wording case and the two that
 *      reach for the button by that verb: a destructive question must not offer
 *      a bare "Confirm".
 *   4. removing `tone: 'danger'` alone fails the wording case, and only that
 *      one, because Cancel stops opening focused.
