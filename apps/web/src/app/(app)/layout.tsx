                (dvh handles the iPad/Safari dynamic toolbar) and never lets the
                document itself scroll. The header stays pinned for every route
                and `main` owns the only vertical scroll — so a page can either
                scroll normally or, like POS, claim the full height and manage
                its own internal scroll regions.

                `relative` is what makes `overflow-hidden` above actually hold.
                A static element does not clip absolutely-positioned descendants
                — their containing block skips past it to the document — so
                `sr-only` (which is `position: absolute`) sitting below the fold
                stretched the DOCUMENT's scroll height and let the whole shell,
                sidebar and header included, scroll off its own edge. It bit the
                product wizard hardest (548 px of overscroll on /products/new,
                the restaurant menu-item editor per D45), but `sr-only` is used
                app-wide, so the lock has to be established here, once. */}
