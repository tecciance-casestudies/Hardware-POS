/**
 * The weight/measure numpad — D134 (`6.3`).
 *
 * A cashier reads an amount off an ordinary offline scale and types it here.
 * There is no device integration and no scale driver: D134's whole argument is
 * that the shop already owns a scale and the cashier can already read it, so the
 * system's job is to accept the number rather than to acquire it.
 *
 * ## What this component does NOT do
 *
 * **It does not compute a price.** It collects a quantity and hands it back.
 * `0.750 × 200` looks too simple to centralise, and that is exactly how `2.12`
 * (four sale-line renderers, two of them fixed) and `3.10` (the till quoting 18%
 * on an item the server zero-rated) happened. One money engine (D59) — the line
 * total comes from the same place every other line total comes from.
 *
 * The running total shown below the keypad is a PREVIEW, computed by the caller
 * from the cart's own rule, not by this component.
