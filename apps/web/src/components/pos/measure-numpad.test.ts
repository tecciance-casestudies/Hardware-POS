/**
 * D134 (`6.3`) — what the weight keypad will and will not accept.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * The decimal cap is asserted at its boundary from BOTH sides: three places are
 * accepted, a fourth is refused. A test that only checked the refusal would pass
 * for a keypad that accepted nothing after the point at all, which would make
 * every weighed sale impossible rather than merely imprecise.
 *
 * `appendKey` is exported for exactly this: the keypad's rules are a pure string
 * function, and testing them through a rendered dialog would prove less and cost
 * more.
