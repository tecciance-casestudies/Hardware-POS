/**
 * D145 — clearing the retail cart asks first, and the asking is the guard.
 *
 * This site is the POSITIVE form: `if (ok) cart.clearCart()`. Nothing about it
 * is visible in the DOM, so the only way to tell a real guard from a button
 * that empties the cart and opens a dialog for decoration is to answer the
 * dialog both ways and watch `clearCart`.
 *
 * So all three assertions are made, and each rules out a different broken
 * version:
 *
 *   - Confirming clears — a component that never resolved the promise, or
 *     dropped the call, passes the cancel case alone.
 *   - Dismissing does NOT clear — a component with the guard removed passes
 *     the confirm case alone.
 *   - Opening the dialog has not cleared anything yet — this is what fails if
 *     the clear were moved ahead of the question and merely announced.
 *
 * Only the Clear control is exercised; the rest of the checkout is stubbed at
 * its data seams (catalogue, cart, auth) so the spec cannot go green or red
 * for a reason that has nothing to do with the confirmation.

/**
 * D171 — every unfinished BUY_X_GET_Y blocks, and says so the same way.
 *
 * ## What changed, and why these assertions were rewritten
 *
 * D166 shipped a same-product prompt that deliberately did NOT block payment,
 * reasoning that five ties at full price is a real sale. Two assertions here
 * pinned that: one required Proceed to Payment to stay ENABLED, and one
 * required the muted prompt to be suppressed while a debt was live.
 *
 * The PO reversed the decision: a customer who qualified for a free item must
 * not leave without it, and every reward offer behaves identically whether the
 * free item is the same product or a different one. So both assertions now
 * state the opposite, deliberately (D16 forbids editing assertions to
 * accommodate a REFACTOR; this is an intentional behaviour change with a
 * decision record behind it).
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * "Both shapes behave the same" is the claim, so it is asserted as a PAIR
 * against the same component: a same-product offer and a cross-product one,
 * each one unit short, must produce the same wording and the same disabled
 * button. A test that only checked the same-product case would pass a till
 * that had started blocking EVERYTHING, which is a worse defect.
 *
 * The two "says nothing" cases are what stop that: a basket that is nowhere
 * near an offer, and one where the reward has already landed, must both pay
 * freely. Without them, "blocks payment" would pass for a till whose button
 * is simply always disabled.
