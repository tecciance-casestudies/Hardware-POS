/**
 * D187 — the payment-complete dialog offers the bill this workspace issues.
 *
 * ## What was reported
 *
 * On a RETAIL till, completing a sale opened a dialog whose primary action was
 * **Print A4 Bill**, beside **Preview A4 Bill** — for a document D163 removed
 * from retail — with the receipt demoted to a text link between them.
 *
 * ## Why nothing caught it
 *
 * D163 gated the Settings screen, the sale page and the "print after payment"
 * toggle on `showA4SaleDocument`. This dialog never consulted it: the page
 * computed `canPrintA4` on line 140 and did not pass it in. Nothing rendered
 * this page, so no test could see it — the component was extracted from
 * `page.tsx` to make this file possible at all.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * Both workspaces are asserted against the SAME component, each with the
 * buttons the other must not have. A dialog that had simply lost its A4 pair
 * would pass the retail case and fail the hardware one; a dialog that ignored
 * the flag would fail retail. Neither case can pass alone.
 *
 * The retail case also pins that the receipt is the PRIMARY action rather than
 * merely present — it was present before, as a text link, which is the defect.
