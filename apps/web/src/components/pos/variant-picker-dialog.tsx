/**
 * D120 (1c.4) — choose which size / pack of a product to sell.
 *
 * A modal rather than a dropdown, for three reasons that all point the same way
 * on a till: the rows are finger-sized on a touchscreen, each one can carry its
 * own stock badge (a cashier must see "Medium — none left" *before* choosing,
 * not after), and `pos-retail-checkout` already suspends the barcode scanner
 * while a modal is open, so a scan cannot fire behind it.
 *
 * The restaurant customise dialog (D46) does the same job for menu items and was
 * the reference for the interaction. It is deliberately not reused: its types are
 * menu-item shaped and it carries modifier groups, which retail has no concept of.
 *
 * One tap adds. Select-then-confirm would be two taps for no gain — the caller
 * only opens this when there is a real choice to make, so the choice IS the
 * confirmation.

/**
 * Which variant a tap on the product card should add without prompting.
 *
 * Returns `null` when the operator has a genuine choice to make and the picker
 * should open instead.
 *
 * The ladder mirrors D46's preselect strategy on the restaurant side, minus the
 * edit-mode case retail does not have:
 *
 *   1. No variants — a plain product. Nothing to choose.
 *   2. Exactly one sellable variant — a one-row modal is a pointless tap.
 *   3. A variant marked `isDefault` — D45 exists for precisely this: "the POS
 *      quick-add path picks this one when the operator taps the product card
 *      without opening the variant picker."
 *   4. Otherwise the picker opens.
 *
 * Out-of-stock variants are excluded from 2 and 3. Quick-adding a size that
 * cannot be sold would put a line in the cart that the server refuses at
 * checkout, which is a worse outcome than one extra tap.
 *
 * Exported for testing: the ladder is the whole behaviour of this step, and it
 * is far easier to prove exhaustively as a function than through the DOM.
