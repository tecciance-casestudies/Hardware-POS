/**
 * D71 — the waiter's bill sheet.
 *
 * ## The claim that matters
 *
 * A split is TWO server calls that cannot be made atomic from the client:
 * close the session (which raises the Sale) and then split that Sale. The
 * dangerous failure is the second one — the table is already closed, and a
 * naive `try { close(); split() } catch { showError() }` would report
 * failure for an operation that half-succeeded, leaving the waiter to press
 * it again against a session that no longer exists.
 *
 * So the middle test asserts the half-failure explicitly: closed, reported
 * as closed, with a message naming what the cashier has to finish. It is
 * paired with the happy path, because a component that always reported
 * "closed with a warning" would satisfy the failure case alone.
 *
 * Totals are asserted to come from the SERVER's preview rather than from
 * re-adding the lines: 3 × 1000 is 3000, but the total shown is 3300 with
 * service charge, and only the server knows that.
 *
 * D178 — the primary action is "Proceed to pay" and calls `sendToCashier`,
 * which raises the Sale exactly as `close` did and holds the table. Every
 * claim below is unchanged; only the verb's name and the wording of the
 * unsent-items question moved with it (recorded in D178).
