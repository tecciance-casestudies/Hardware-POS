/**
 * D155 — "order so far": what the table already has, and the void.
 *
 * ## Why these claims
 *
 * This sheet carries the two capabilities the retired `/tables/session/[id]`
 * screen held and the POS did not: the kitchen's progress on each round, and
 * `ORDER_VOID_SENT`. Both fail silently if they are wrong —
 *
 *   - a sheet that rendered rounds without their status would look complete and
 *     answer the wrong question (the bill sheet already prices the order; what
 *     this adds is whether it is cooked), so the STATUS is asserted, per round
 *     and per item;
 *   - a void offered to every role looks identical to a correct gate until a
 *     waiter taps it and the server answers 403, so Void is asserted present
 *     WITH the permission and absent without it, on the same fixture;
 *   - a void that posted no reason would still close the dialog and reload, so
 *     the reason that reaches `voidItem` is asserted, and the guard that refuses
 *     an empty one with it.
 *
 * Mutation-proven, each mutation run against the component itself:
 *   1. `canVoid` ignored (Void rendered unconditionally) — 1 failed, 5 passed:
 *      the permission case, which is the only one that can catch it;
 *   2. the DRAFT skip removed from `flattenSubmittedRounds` — 3 failed, 3
 *      passed: the draft round joins the list, the reported count becomes 3,
 *      and its line offers a Void for something the kitchen has never seen;
 *   3. `onConfirm(reason.trim())` called with `''` — 1 failed, 5 passed: the
 *      posted reason is what the audit record is made of.
