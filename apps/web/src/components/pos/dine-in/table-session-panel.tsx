 * every table on the branch is in exactly one place and no chip combination
 * can hide it (D91 shipped All/Free/Open chips beside the areas — two
 * selections, six combinations, and the PO wanted one row of destinations).
 *
 * The sentinel is client-only state that is never stored or sent, and area ids
 * are cuids, so it cannot collide with one. This is deliberately NOT the

 * looping the areas, and `GET /restaurant/dining-areas/:areaId/tables` filters
 * on `areaId`. A waiter could create one on the Tables screen and then never
 * find it in the POS.
 *
 * They live under OPEN — always, seated or not — as their own group above the
 * floors. An earlier pass gave them a separate "Joined" chip; the PO wanted
 * them under Open, and on reflection that is also the truer reading of D92's
 * partition: every table on the branch is in exactly one place, and an
 * arrangement's place is Open. Unlike a physical table, it does not move when
 * the party sits down — under D104 an arrangement can be BOTH occupied and
 * seatable, so filing it by status would make it flicker between destinations

 * other table on this screen — the ONE thing that differs is what its secondary
 * line says while it is free (`freeDetail`: seats on a physical table, member
 * codes on an arrangement). If seating a joined table ever drifted from seating
 * a physical one, it would drift here, silently.
 *
 * Three kinds of table, and the difference is what a tap does: seat a free one,
 * carry on with one of mine, and neither for anyone else's. The last is still
 * DRAWN — seeing that M4 is taken is the whole point of the PO's request (D91)
 * — but the server refuses to hand it over (D70), so offering the tap would be
 * offering a refusal.

/**
 * D104 — the prompt that opens a tab on an arrangement.
 *
 * Two questions, and both exist because a group is shared. The guest count is
 * what the server subtracts from the seats, so without it the "4 taken, 2 free"
 * on the chip would be a number nobody maintains. The tab name is what the
 * kitchen ticket and the bill are headed with, and it is the only thing that
 * tells two parties on one arrangement apart — so it is required exactly when
 * a sibling tab already exists, and optional when this is the first.
 *
 * Physical tables get no dialog at all: they carry one party, so there is
 * nothing to disambiguate and the one-tap seat stays one tap.
