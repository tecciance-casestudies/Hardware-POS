/**
 * The app's own confirm and prompt (D145) — the primitive every converted call
 * site now depends on.
 *
 * Nine guards moved onto this hook in one change. Each of them reads
 * `if (!(await confirm(…))) return;` or `if (raw == null) return;`, which means
 * a single mistake HERE is a mistake at all nine at once — and the two ways it
 * would fail are both silent:
 *
 *   • Resolving the wrong value. `confirm` answering true on Cancel deletes the
 *     thing the person just declined to delete. `prompt` answering `''` where
 *     `window.prompt` answered `null` turns "I changed my mind" into "clear the
 *     field", which is exactly the distinction the wizard's reorder-point guard
 *     is built on (`raw == null`, deliberately not `!raw`).
 *   • Resolving NOTHING. A promise nobody settles is an `await` that never
 *     returns: the handler behind it simply stops, with no error, no dialog and
 *     nothing on screen. Every outcome below is therefore asserted through
 *     `outcome()`, which races the promise against a timer — so "never
 *     answered" fails as itself rather than as a five-second timeout.
 *
 * The three paths that can leave a promise hanging each get their own test:
 * unmount, a second question arriving over the first, and dismissal.
 *
 * ## Mutation proof (D30)
 *
 * Seven mutants of `confirm.tsx`, each run against this spec in a scratch copy
 * and then reverted. All seven were killed:
 *
 *   1. Cancel resolves `true` ....................... 5 tests fail
 *   2. prompt dismissal resolves `''`, not `null` ... 5 tests fail
 *   3. the unmount effect stops settling ............ 1 test fails
 *   4. a second question DROPS the first ............ 3 tests fail
 *   5. `tone: 'danger'` no longer focuses Cancel .... 1 test fails
 *   6. the field is not reset between questions ..... 1 test fails
 *   7. the hook falls back to a stub instead of
 *      throwing without its provider ................ 1 test fails
