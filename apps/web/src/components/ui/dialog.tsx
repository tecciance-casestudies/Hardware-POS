   * only hides what passes behind its own painted box: every transparent strip
   * around it (the body's own padding, a `space-y` gap to the first row) turns
   * into a slot where rows are seen sliding past, and closing them one at a
   * time is whack-a-mole. A `shrink-0` sibling of the scroller cannot have the
   * problem — the body clips at its own edge, and there is nothing above that
   * edge to see through. The body's top padding is dropped when a toolbar is
   * present, so the first row meets the toolbar with no gap between them.

/**
 * Lightweight modal (overlay + centred card). Closes on Escape / overlay click.
 *
 * ## Height (D85)
 *
 * The card is capped at 80% of the viewport and lays out as a column: header
 * and footer hold their size, the BODY scrolls. Without that cap a dialog
 * grows with its content and runs off both ends of the screen — and the
 * footer goes with it, so the confirm button on a long bill or a long split
 * list is somewhere below the fold with no way to reach it.
 *
 * `dvh`, not `vh`: on a phone or an iPad in Safari the toolbar collapses and
 * expands, and `vh` measures the tallest state, which is exactly the state
 * where the dialog does not fit.
 *
 * The cap is a MAXIMUM. A short dialog is still only as tall as its content.
