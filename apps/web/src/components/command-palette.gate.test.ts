 * D93 — the Ctrl+K POS command is gated like the POS rail entry.
 *
 * Why this file exists: the palette hand-copies every destination from the nav
 * lists, so it had a SECOND permission gate with no test behind it at all — the
 * whole web suite stayed green with that gate fully fail-open. A review caught
 * it. The gate is now derived from the nav specs rather than retyped, and this
 * pins the derivation.
 *
 * The palette itself is not rendered here: it needs a router, an auth context
 * and a keyboard. The thing worth testing is the GATE, which is data.
 */

 * THE SHIPPED value, imported — not a local re-derivation. The first draft of
 * this file copied the derivation out of the component, and mutating the
 * component's own copy left every test here green: a mirror asserts about
 * itself. That is the vacuity D30 is written against, and it was caught by
 * running the mutation rather than by reading the test.
