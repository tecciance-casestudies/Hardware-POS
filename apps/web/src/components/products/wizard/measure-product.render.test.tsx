/**
 * D134 (`6.1`) — the product form can declare a product sold by weight.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at all
 *
 * `6.1` shipped `quantityType` on the column, the DTO, the read model and the
 * till, and shipped **no way to set it**. A measured product could only be made
 * by writing to the database directly. Every test passed, because every test
 * exercised a layer that already had the value handed to it.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * The pure rules are asserted from BOTH sides — a measured product with no unit
 * is refused, and one WITH a unit is accepted. A test that only checked the
 * refusal would pass for a form that rejected every product ever, which is a
 * worse defect than the one it guards.
 *
 * They are also driven through the RENDERED control rather than only through
 * `validateStep` and `buildCreateInput`. That is the specific gap this file was
 * written for: pure-function tests over the wizard's helpers stay green when the
 * card is never rendered, which is exactly the state `6.1` shipped in.
