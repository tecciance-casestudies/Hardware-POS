/**
 * Inventory tab bar (D45).
 *
 * Sits at the top of `/products`, `/products/categories`,
 * `/products/promotions`, `/products/attributes` and `/products/barcodes` so
 * the surfaces read as one Inventory area rather than several unrelated
 * screens.
 *
 * The two Phase 5 tabs are here rather than in the main rail because
 * `nav.test.ts` asserts the retail rail as an EXACT sequence, mutation-proven,
 * and D16 forbids editing an existing behavioural assertion to accommodate new
 * work. They are also catalogue sub-surfaces, which is what this bar is for.
 *
 * D162 — and those two are not for every workspace. Attributes (the reusable
 * variation library) is retail's; Barcodes (in-store EAN-13 allocation) is for
 * anyone who stocks and labels physical goods, so hardware keeps it and a
 * kitchen does not. The bar does NOT decide that: it reads flags from
 * `resolveCatalogueTabs`, because a component that compares a business type is
 * exactly what D56 and the products resolver exist to prevent.
 *
 * Hiding is usability. Both routes still answer to anyone who types the URL
 * and holds the permission; D125 made `/attribute-library` shared core on
 * purpose, and nothing here changes an authority.
 *
 * Each tab is a plain `<Link>` — routing lives with Next, not with local state
 * — so a mid-list refresh, back button or shareable URL all behave correctly.
 *
 * "Stock" and "Purchases" are surfaced as placeholder tabs with a matching
 * disabled state, per the D45 note. Placing them here rather than hiding them
 * gives operators the mental map of the eventual inventory area without
 * shipping a broken route.
