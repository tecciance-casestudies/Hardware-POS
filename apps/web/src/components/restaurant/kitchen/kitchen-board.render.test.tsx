/**
 * The kitchen board after D100 — age escalation, a kitchen-sized bump, and
 * recall — and after D152, which puts the station back on it.
 *
 * Everything is pinned in pairs, because each half alone is also what a
 * broken board produces:
 *
 * - Escalation: a late ticket turns red AND a fresh board carries no
 *   warning colour at all — asserting only the red half would pass on a
 *   board that painted everything red.
 * - The write gate mirrors WS-408's contrast: without KITCHEN_STATUS_UPDATE
 *   there is no Mark done and no Recall, while Details still counts the
 *   tickets (the positive control that proves the board rendered).
 * - Both verbs drop the card optimistically — the reload must not resurrect
 *   it, so the api mocks empty their rows when the verb lands.
 * - Layout: `h-full` and `mt-auto` are asserted together, because either one
 *   alone still describes a row of cards whose buttons fail to line up; the
 *   provenance row is pinned by what its row does NOT contain (the timer),
 *   which is the whole of what moving it changed.
 * - D152's ribbon is pinned by where it sits as well as by what it says:
 *   "the station is on the card" passes on the pre-D68 board too, where the
 *   station was the first grey item of a truncated subtitle, so every ribbon
 *   assertion is paired with the subtitle no longer carrying it.
 * - The station FILTER's every half has a passing twin that describes a broken
 *   board: a strip that is always shown, a filter that hides everything, and a
 *   memory that never forgets.
 * - D154's poll is asserted against the API mocks' CALL COUNTS, because a poll
 *   that never pauses and one that never resumes render the same board — and
 *   "one request per tick" is invisible on screen by definition. Both halves
 *   again: hidden must stop the interval, and coming back must refetch at once
 *   rather than waiting out the remainder of one.
 * - D174's station-scoped lane counts are pinned by a fixture in which the
 *   branch's number, each station's number and the poison the abandoned path
 *   answers ALL DIFFER, so "the chip carries a number" cannot pass on the wrong
 *   one; and the list read is asserted to stay UNSCOPED, because the station
 *   strip is counted from it and a server-cut list would read zero on every
 *   station but the one selected.

/*
 * `expectNoUnroutedWarning` is the one blanket ABSENCE claim left in this file
 * after D152 put the station back on screen, and an absence claim is the
 * easiest kind of test to leave vacuous. It is shown below to fail against the
 * exact markup it forbids, rendered verbatim.
 *
 * Beyond it, the real components were mutated on a scratch copy taken outside
 * the repo and this suite re-run against each mutation; every one went red
 * where it should and green again on restore. What each killed:
 *
 * - The ribbon demoted below the title, inside CardContent — "promotes the
 *   station out of the subtitle into a ribbon atop the card" (the
 *   `firstElementChild` half).
 * - The ribbon's two ends swapped, round first — "carries the round at the far
 *   end of the ribbon".
 * - The round's null guard dropped, printing a bare "Round" — "leaves the round
 *   half empty".
 * - The station put back at the head of the provenance line, as D68 had it —
 *   "promotes the station…" (the subtitle half) and "carries the round…".
 * - `overflow-hidden` off the Card — "promotes the station…". Separately,
 *   `h-full` off the Card and `mt-auto` off the actions each fail "pins the
 *   actions to the bottom", which is why that pair is asserted together.
 * - `hasRibbon` forced true — "drops the band entirely when there is neither a
 *   station nor a round"; forced false — the six ribbon tests plus its pair.
 * - The station chip left off the dialog's item lines — "the Details dialog
 *   names the station on each item line".
 * - The dialog's null branch printing the pre-D147 "no station" warning again —
 *   the same test's negative half.
 * - The station cut never applied (`scoped` = `tickets`) — "cuts the board to
 *   one station", "counts the lane per station", "never lets a stationless
 *   ticket fall off every view", "says which station is empty" and both
 *   remembered-station tests.
 * - The strip shown for a single station (`stations.length > 0`) — "offers no
 *   strip when the branch has a single station".
 * - `isActive` no longer filtered off the station list — "leaves an archived
 *   station off the strip".
 * - The choice never persisted (`selectStation` without the localStorage
 *   write) — "remembers the station across a remount".
 * - The chime ignoring the station (`heard` = `next`) — "hears its own station
 *   and stays deaf to the others"; the station dropped from the baseline key —
 *   "re-baselines on a station switch".
 * - The archived cleanup running before the list arrives (the
 *   `stations.length === 0` guard removed) — "does not clear a remembered
 *   station just because the list failed to arrive".
 * - The archived cleanup removed entirely — "drops a remembered station that no
 *   longer exists".
 * - The server counts dropped altogether — all four D142b chip tests. (The
 *   D152-era mutant beside it, `laneCount` reading the server count under a
 *   cut, is what D174 SHIPS; its inverse is proven in the D174 block below.)
 * - `COMPLETED` in place of `COMPLETED_TODAY` — "asks the server for the
 *   day-scoped lane" and the other tests that reach the Done lane, since the
 *   fixture answers that token with the OUTSTANDING rows rather than pretending
 *   both are the same lane.
 * - The lane cut ignoring IN_PROGRESS — five lane tests, the control that says
 *   `inLane` is doing the work the counts and the board both read from.
 *
 * D154's own mutants, run the same way — pristine copies taken outside the
 * repo, the suite re-run against each mutation, the files restored
 * byte-for-byte afterwards. All twelve were killed:
 *
 * - The visibility gate removed, so the poll never pauses — "does not poll a
 *   hidden tab", and both catch-up tests, which then count a fetch nobody
 *   asked for.
 * - The `focus`/`visibilitychange` listeners removed with the gate KEPT —
 *   "refetches the moment the board is looked at again" and "comes back on
 *   window focus too". That pair is the whole difference between a poll that
 *   pauses and one that has stalled.
 * - The second request put back (`kitchen.laneCounts` after the list, on an
 *   UNFILTERED board) — "spends ONE request per tick", "takes the other lane's
 *   number from the ticket read", the failed-poll test and both D142b chip
 *   tests: the 911 the spy answers without a station reaches the strip. (D174
 *   re-runs this as M4 below, against the fixture that answers per station.)
 * - `setCounts(next.counts)` dropped — the same five bar the request-count one.
 *   The chips go bare rather than wrong, which is why the two are separate
 *   mutants and not one.
 * - `setStatus('error')` made unconditional on a failed poll — "keeps the last
 *   cards and the last numbers when a poll fails": the lane blanks and the
 *   message appears twice.
 * - The status left alone entirely on failure — "says so when the FIRST load
 *   fails", which then spins on "Loading tickets…" for ever.
 * - `setTickets([])` added to the catch, counts kept — the same failed-poll
 *   test from the other side, and the half a numbers-only assertion would miss.
 * - The chime baseline built from an empty set instead of the response rows —
 *   "stays silent when the poll returns the same tickets" and both D152 chime
 *   tests: the control that says the chime still keys off THIS response.
 * - The envelope rendered in place of `.items` — 59 of the 65 tests here, which
 *   is the shape check the rest of the file performs for nothing.
 * - In api.ts, `listTickets` typed back to `KitchenTicketView[]` — not a test
 *   failure but a tsc one, in BOTH callers (`.items`/`.counts` on an array).
 *   That is what makes the envelope's type load-bearing rather than decorative,
 *   since every test in this file mocks the client and would never see it.
 *
 * D174's mutants — station-scoped lane counts — run the same way (pristine
 * copy outside the repo, suite re-run per mutant, restored byte-for-byte and
 * compared). All nine were killed:
 *
 * - M1 the tag ignored (`laneCount` reads whatever station the counts answer)
 *   — "shows no number rather than the wrong station's while the station's is
 *   on its way" and "does not relabel the branch's number … when the cut's
 *   first poll fails". These two are the tag's whole justification; nothing
 *   else notices, which is why they hold the counts read open.
 * - M2 D152's withholding put back (`stationId ? null : …`) — "carries every
 *   lane's number under a cut", "carries the station's number on the Done lane
 *   too", "counts the lane per station" (its Done 4) and the on-its-way test's
 *   positive control.
 * - M3 the LIST read scoped on the server (`stationId` passed to
 *   `listTickets`) — "counts the lane per station" reads "Grill 0" from the
 *   cut list, and the call-shape pins in it and in "carries every lane's
 *   number" trip. This is the one the strip depends on, and the fixture
 *   honouring a station argument is what lets it fail on the NUMBER and not
 *   only on the call shape.
 * - M4 the counts route asked on an unfiltered board too — the two D154
 *   request-count tests and the three cut tests: the 911 the spy answers
 *   without a station reaches the strip.
 * - M5 the counts route never asked (envelope counts under a cut) — the five
 *   cut tests: "Done 7" stands over Main Kitchen.
 * - M6 the tag always `null` — four cut tests: the chip never fills.
 * - M7 a failing counts read swallowed (`.catch(() => null)`, envelope counts
 *   in its place) — "does not relabel … when the cut's first poll fails",
 *   which is the pin for "one failure fails the tick".
 * - M8 the strip counted from the SCOPED list (`inLane(scoped, filter)`) —
 *   "counts the lane per station" and the Grill 1 in "carries every lane's
 *   number": D152's "zero on every station but one".
 * - M9 in api.ts, `laneCounts` losing its `stationId` parameter — a tsc
 *   failure at the board's call (`Expected 2 arguments, but got 3`), not a
 *   test one, for the same reason as the envelope mutant above.
