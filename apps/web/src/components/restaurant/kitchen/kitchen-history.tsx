/**
 * D142, D150 — the kitchen's history: every ticket this branch's kitchen holds.
 *
 * The board's Done lane answers "what have we finished this service" and is
 * cut to the shop's day. This answers the question that outgrew it — "when did
 * that go out, and who was on it" — over a set that only grows, so it pages and
 * searches on the SERVER. Today's tickets are in it deliberately: the lane
 * drops a ticket at midnight, and a screen that started the day after would
 * leave the one bumped an hour ago findable in neither place.
 *
 * D150 — and every LANE, not just Done. The server used to filter this list to
 * COMPLETED, so a round still queued or on the pass was on this screen nowhere:
 * searching its ticket number here answered "no tickets match" about a ticket
 * hanging on the board. The table was always built for all of it — the badge
 * names the lane, and an unfinished row simply has no finish stamp and nobody
 * to name — so what changed is the query behind it and the words around it.
 * Cancelled work stays out (D115) and there is still no date bound (D142).
 *
 * No polling. A record of what already happened does not move under the reader,
 * and a five-second refresh would fight the operator's paging.
 *
 * D152 — seven columns, and the seventh is the station again. D147 cut a round
 * down to ONE ticket routed nowhere, because there was no dependable place to
 * say which station cooks a dish. The station is now chosen when a menu item is
 * created, and a branch's "Main" catches anything still undecided, so a ticket
 * is one station's share of a round once more — and "which section cooked that"
 * is a question this record can answer again.
 *
 * D175 — the station and the table are FILTERS now, not legs of the search
 * term. D152 had put the station name back into the free-text search beside the
 * ticket number, the order number, where it went and the dishes; a term is the
 * wrong tool for either. "Grill" typed into a box that also matches dish names
 * finds the grilled prawns as readily as the Grill station, and "3" finds every
 * ticket with a 3 in its number. Both are closed sets the branch already knows,
 * so the panel under the Filters button offers them as chips — multi-select on
 * each axis, and the two axes AND together on the server — while the term keeps
 * the three things that are genuinely typed from memory: ticket number, order
 * number and dish. The table is the session's table, so a takeaway ticket has
 * none and is on this screen only while the table set is empty.
 *
 * The station is NULLABLE here and stays that way. A ticket cut during the D147
 * window was routed to no station and nothing was backfilled, so those rows have
 * no name to print and get the same em dash this table uses everywhere else for
 * a value it simply does not have — not "no station", which would describe a
 * routing fault that D152 has made impossible. Such a ticket belongs to no
 * station and so is under no station chip either.

                        nothing. The failure case defers to the banner above —

                        list now holds unfinished work too, so the old wording

                        the fact that this screen would have shown it.

                        set filter with no term is "no match" too: "nothing has
                        reached this kitchen" over a Grill chip would tell a
