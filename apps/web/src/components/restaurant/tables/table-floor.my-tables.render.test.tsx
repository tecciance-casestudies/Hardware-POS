/**
 * D156 — the floor opens on MY tables, and the whole floor is one tap away.
 *
 * ## Why these claims
 *
 * The server now returns the branch's sessions to a waiter (D70 withheld them),
 * so the screen is the only thing standing between a waiter and a list that
 * mixes their three tables with the room's eleven — which is precisely what D70
 * was protecting against when it solved the problem by making colleagues
 * invisible. Each half therefore has to be asserted against its opposite on the
 * same data:
 *
 *   - "defaults to mine" is indistinguishable from "drops sessions it cannot
 *     parse" unless the same render also proves the colleague's table IS there
 *     once All is tapped;
 *   - "All shows everything" is indistinguishable from "the filter does
 *     nothing" unless Mine is proven to hide the same card;
 *   - D157b: a default computed from the data moved AFTER the first paint in
 *     one direction or the other (the two flickers the PO reported), so the
 *     no-tables-of-mine case is asserted to STAY on mine with the All chip
 *     naming what is there — the screen offers the room rather than taking the
 *     operator to it.
 *
 * The card's "View order" link is what each case counts, because it exists ONLY
 * for a session the floor is showing: the table itself renders either way, so
 * querying the table name would pass against a broken filter.
 *
 * Mutation-proven, each mutation run against the components themselves:
 *   1. reading `snapshot.sessionsByTableId` instead of `visibleSessions` at the
 *      table-card call site (the scope honoured by the chips and ignored by the
 *      cards) — 3 failed, 2 passed;
 *   2. `resolveOwnerScope` returning `chosen ?? 'all'` (a waiter opens on the
 *      whole room) — 2 failed, 3 passed;
 *   3. `resolveOwnerScope` ignoring `chosen` (the poll-stomping shape) — 3
 *      failed, 2 passed;
 *   4. D157b: the pre-D157b data-driven default restored
 *      (`mineCount > 0 ? 'mine' : 'all'`) — 2 failed, 4 passed: the
 *      no-tables-of-mine case and the first-paint case;
 *   5. D156a: the server's name taken from the SCOPED session the card renders
 *      (`servedBy={s?.waiterName}`) instead of the branch snapshot — 2 failed,
 *      5 passed: a colleague's table goes anonymous the moment the operator
 *      narrows to their own;
 *   6. D156a: the pre-D156a "only when it is not mine" rule restored — 2
 *      failed, 5 passed.
