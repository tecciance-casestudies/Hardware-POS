/**
 * D157 — "My orders / All orders" on the queue.
 *
 * The PO's report: a waiter working the floor could not find their own orders
 * here — the tab has always listed the whole branch. The scope is the server's
 * (the list is paged, so a client-side filter would narrow one page and call it
 * the total), which makes this spec about the three things the SCREEN owns:
 * what it sends, which chip it lights, and whose name it puts on a row.
 *
 * Paired per D30, because each failure looks like the other working:
 *
 *   - "sends nothing on a first load" is what lets the server pick the default,
 *     and is indistinguishable from a dropped parameter unless the chip tap is
 *     also asserted to send one;
 *   - the active chip comes from `resolvedScope` (the server may have chosen),
 *     so it is asserted against a response that chose the OTHER one;
 *   - a name on every row would look like a name on the right rows, so the
 *     operator's own row is asserted to carry none.
 *
 * Mutation-proven, each run against the component itself:
 *   1. `scope` dropped from the API call — 1 failed, 4 passed;
 *   2. the chips lit from the URL (`scope`) instead of `resolvedScope` — 2
 *      failed, 3 passed: a first load lights NEITHER chip, because the URL
 *      carries nothing until the operator taps one;
 *   3. `staffLabel` replaced with `r.staffName` (every row named) — 1 failed,
 *      4 passed.
