/**
 * D172 — the dashboard's quick actions go where they say they go.
 *
 * ## What was reported
 *
 * "in dashbord in retail when click on 'view reports' btn its goes to sales
 * its needed to go to reports"
 *
 * It did. The action was labelled "View Reports", carried the Reports icon and
 * was gated on `REPORT_READ` — every signal about it said Reports except the
 * one that decides where the browser goes.
 *
 * ## Why nothing caught it
 *
 * Nothing rendered this dashboard. A wrong `href` is invisible to typechecking
 * (it is a string), invisible to lint, and invisible to every other spec in the
 * suite. It can only be caught by asserting the destination, which is what this
 * file does and what did not exist.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * Each action is asserted by its EXACT destination, not by "a link exists" —
 * the bug was a link that existed and worked and went somewhere real, so
 * presence proves nothing here.
 *
 * The reports case also asserts the old wrong value is gone. `/sales` is a
 * legitimate destination elsewhere on this screen (several KPI cards drill into
 * it on purpose), so "does not link to /sales" has to be said about this action
 * specifically rather than about the page.
 *
 * The other two actions are the control: they pin destinations this change did
 * not touch, so "the reports link is right" cannot pass because the action list
 * collapsed to one entry or every href was rewritten.
