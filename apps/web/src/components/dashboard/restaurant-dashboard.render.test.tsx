/**
 * The service dashboard: the reservations card, and the promise that the page
 * fits its screen (D148).
 *
 * Two claims, and they pull against each other — which is the whole reason
 * this spec exists. Adding a fourth panel is the obvious way to make a
 * dashboard scroll, and "it fits" is the kind of thing that is true on the
 * developer's monitor and false on the tablet by the pass.
 *
 * The fit is asserted as the CSS contract rather than by measuring pixels,
 * because jsdom lays nothing out: no element has a height here, so a test that
 * measured one would pass on any markup at all. What IS provable is the
 * mechanism — the page is height-bounded, the panel row absorbs the slack, and
 * each card is the scroller instead of the page. Every one of those is
 * asserted positively AND negatively, since dropping any single one puts the
 * scroll back on the page while the other two still read correctly.
 *
 * ## Mutation proof (D30)
 *
 * Eight mutants of restaurant-dashboard.tsx, each run against this spec and
 * then reverted. All eight were killed:
 *
 *   1. the card is dropped from the panel row .............. 6 tests fail
 *   2. `lg:h-full` removed from the page root .............. 1 test fails
 *   3. `lg:flex-1` removed from the panel row .............. 1 test fails
 *   4. `lg:overflow-y-auto` removed from the card bodies ... 1 test fails
 *   5. `lg:auto-rows-fr` removed from the panel row ........ 1 test fails
 *   6. the permission gate renders an empty card instead
 *      of saying the book is not theirs ................... 1 test fails
 *   7. the soonest-first sort is dropped ................... 1 test fails
 *   8. the window is anchored to midnight, not to now ...... 1 test fails
 *
 * Mutants 2 through 5 are the ones that matter most: each removes ONE of the
 * four rules that together keep the page off a scrollbar, and each is caught
 * by exactly one test. That is the evidence that the four assertions are
 * independent rather than four spellings of the same check.
 *
 * D154 adds the kitchen read's envelope, and two more mutants, applied and
 * reverted the same way. Both were killed:
 *
 *   9. the `.catch` moved BEHIND the `.items` read ......... 1 test fails
 *  10. the envelope passed on without unwrapping `.items` .. 10 tests fail
 *
 * Mutant 9 is the one this spec exists for: it is invisible for as long as the
 * kitchen answers, and takes the WHOLE dashboard down the first time it does
 * not — a fallback of the wrong shape is a fallback that does not fall back.
