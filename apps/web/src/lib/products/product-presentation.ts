/**
 * How the product screens present themselves for one tenant's inventory mode.
 *
 * ## Why a resolver and not conditionals in JSX
 *
 * Slice 6C-B moved catalogue synchronisation behind a provider on the server so
 * `ProductsService` holds no profile conditional. The frontend has the same hazard
 * in a different form: `inventoryMode === 'QUICKBOOKS'` sprinkled through a table,
 * a detail page, a form and three wizard steps is nine places to forget, and the
 * one that is forgotten shows a LOCAL tenant a QuickBooks requirement that does not
 * apply to them.
 *
 * So every mode-dependent decision is taken here, once, and the components read
 * flags. A structural test enforces that: the product components may not name an
 * inventory mode themselves.
 *
 * ## What it is NOT allowed to do
 *
 * It never infers the mode. `syncStatus`, `quickbooksItemId`, the product name, the
 * business type and the presence of a QuickBooks connection are all incapable of
 * distinguishing "this tenant does not use QuickBooks" from "this tenant uses
 * QuickBooks and this product has not reached it yet". The mode arrives from
 * `GET /v1/platform/profile` and nowhere else; the two product fields are inputs to
 * *presentation within* a mode, never to the choice of mode.
 *
 * ## Hiding is usability, not security
 *
 * Every flag here only decides what is drawn. The server still resolves the tenant's
 * provider from the authenticated session and refuses a QuickBooks push for a LOCAL
 * or DISABLED tenant whatever the browser sends.

 * D162 — which sub-surfaces the Inventory tab bar offers this workspace.
 *
 * `Products → Attributes` and `Products → Barcodes` shipped for everyone, and
 * they are not for everyone: a kitchen barcodes nothing and keeps no library
 * of size scales, and a hardware counter types a variation when it needs one.
 *
 * ## Why one function returning two flags
 *
 * They are one question — "what does this tab bar show?" — asked once, by one
 * component. Two exported predicates would let a future third tab be gated in
 * a third place, which is the scattering `product-presentation.ts` exists to
 * prevent. The tab bar reads the object and filters; it names no capability.
 *
 * ## Why not `ProductBusinessKind`
 *
 * Same reason `resolveMeasuredGoods` is its own resolver: that kind is a
 * COARSE split whose `RETAIL` covers hardware and general trade as well as
 * retail, and these two flags differ WITHIN it — hardware keeps Barcodes and
 * loses Attributes. The coarse kind cannot express that.
 *
 * ## Unresolved hides both
 *
 * D31. A tab that appears a beat after the page loads, or worse vanishes
 * under a click, is worse than one that arrived late. Both default to
 * `false` while the profile is loading and after a failed request.
 *
 * ## Hiding is usability
 *
 * Neither route is removed and neither API is gated: `/products/attributes`
 * and `/products/barcodes` still answer to anyone who types the URL and holds
 * the permission. D125 made `/attribute-library` shared core on purpose. This
 * decides what the bar draws, and nothing else.
