/**
 * D161 — the label→key derivation.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous
 *
 * The interesting property is not "Material becomes material" — that holds for
 * `toLowerCase`. It is that EVERY label a person can type produces a key the
 * server's pattern accepts, including the ones that produce nothing usable on
 * their own. So the pattern is asserted against every case here rather than a
 * hand-picked expected string being asserted alone, and the pattern itself is
 * proven to reject before it is used to accept — a regex that matched anything
 * would make every one of these pass.
 *
 * The uniqueness cases pair a collision with a non-collision, because a
 * suffixer that appended `2` unconditionally would satisfy the collision case
 * by itself and would rename every field on every save.
