/**
 * The printed kitchen ticket (D153).
 *
 * The renderer is pure, so the whole format is assertable here and the only
 * thing left untested is the browser's own print dialog. That matters more
 * than usual for this document: nobody reviews a KOT on screen. It goes
 * straight from a button to a thermal head to a cook, and a line that failed
 * to print is discovered when the plate is wrong.
 *
 * Every assertion below is paired. The four things the PO asked to REMOVE are
 * absences, and an absence asserted against a fixture that never had the thing
 * proves nothing (D30) — so each fixture carries the value that would print if
 * the renderer changed its mind: a customer name on the input type would not
 * compile, so the guard there is the type; for the rest the fixture supplies
 * real modifiers, real instructions and a real item count.
