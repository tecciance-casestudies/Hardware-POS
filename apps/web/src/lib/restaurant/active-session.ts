/**
 * D155 — "which session is the POS taking orders onto", resolved in one place.
 *
 * The dine-in POS learns its table two ways now: the waiter picks one from the
 * panel's grid, or the floor plan hands one over in the URL
 * (`/pos?mode=dine-in&sessionId=…`). Both need the SAME two answers — what the
 * table is called, and what the session's shape is — and the label is the half
 * that is easy to get wrong: no endpoint returns it. `GET /open-sessions`
 * carries a `tableId`, and the name behind that id lives in the area listings
 * (a physical table) or the open-tables listing (an arrangement, which belongs
 * to no area and is therefore absent from every per-area read).
 *
 * So it is resolved here rather than twice in two components, per D28/D31: the
 * decision lives in one place and the component reads a result. A deep link
 * that fell back to the session number would put "TS-000042" on the strip, the
 * bill sheet and the POS header — the one thing the waiter cannot recognise.
