/**
 * The kitchen board's new-ticket chime — a RISING two-note ding (A5→D6),
 * the shape mainstream KDS products use for "something arrived".
 *
 * D118 (PO): the KITCHEN is the only screen that makes sound. The orders
 * queue's arrival chime and the D112/D114 food-ready bell were removed —
 * those screens inform visually (badges, tabs, counts). This module stays
 * the single home for POS audio should any of it be invited back.
 *
 * Synthesised with Web Audio rather than shipped as an asset: short sine
 * tones need no file to bundle and no network fetch on a POS terminal.
 *
 * Browsers block audio until the user has interacted with the page. On a
 * terminal that is being worked this is already satisfied; on a freshly
 * opened, untouched tab the chime is skipped rather than queued — a burst of
 * stale dings on the first tap would be worse than a missed one. Audio is
 * best-effort throughout: no failure here may ever break the screen using it.
