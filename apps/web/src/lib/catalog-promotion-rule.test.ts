/**
 * The till's promotion wire mapper must not drop a field.
 *
 * ## The defect this exists for
 *
 * D126 added `minimumSpend` to `PromotionRule`, declared it OPTIONAL, and
 * `toPromotionRule` was not updated. Building the object without it type-checked
 * cleanly — a missing optional field is a valid value — so the till received
 * `undefined`, read it as "no threshold", and took Rs 1,000 off a Rs 500 basket
 * from a promotion configured to need Rs 10,000.
 *
 * This is the SAME failure as 4.15's dropped `productName`, in the same kind of
 * mapper, three commits later. The structural answer shipped with the fix:
 * `minimumSpend` is now REQUIRED on `PromotionRule`, so the compiler refuses a
 * mapper that forgets it. This spec is the belt to that braces — it fails on the
 * value being wrong, which the compiler cannot see.
 *
 * ## What makes these assertions non-vacuous (D30)
 *
 * The threshold is asserted POSITIVELY (a real value survives) and NEGATIVELY
 * (an absent one becomes `null`, never `undefined`). The negative is the one
 * that matters: `undefined` and `null` behave identically under `?? 0` in the
 * applier, so only an explicit `toBeNull()` distinguishes a mapper that carries
 * the field from one that merely happens not to crash.
 *
 * Every other field is asserted in the same pass, because the way this bug
 * arrives is "someone added a field and updated the type but not the mapper" —
 * so the test has to notice the NEXT one too, not just this one.
