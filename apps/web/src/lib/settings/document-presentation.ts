/**
 * What the Settings screen shows, for the document this tenant actually prints.
 *
 * ## Why a resolver and not conditionals in JSX
 *
 * Settings is one 650-line page with six tab components, and the question
 * "does this tenant print on A4 or on an 80mm roll?" reaches nine of them. Left
 * as `profile?.capabilities…` comparisons that is nine places to forget, and
 * the one that is forgotten offers a restaurant a signature upload it can never
 * use — the same hazard `product-presentation.ts` exists for, in a second
 * screen. So the decision is taken here once and the tabs read flags. A
 * structural test enforces it: no settings component may name a capability, a
 * business type or an inventory mode itself.
 *
 * ## Why capabilities and not `businessType`
 *
 * D56 — business-type comparisons have exactly one home, the domain registry.
 * `documents.proformaBill` names the DOCUMENT rather than the service model,
 * which is the property this screen is actually about: a future takeaway-only
 * bakery prints a bill without ever seating anyone, and HOTEL inherits the
 * right answer through the food-service capability set rather than through a
 * list of business types somebody has to remember to extend. HOTEL is the value
 * the seven hand-written predicates D56 replaced had all independently
 * forgotten.
 *
 * ## Unresolved is its own state
 *
 * While the profile is loading, and after a failed request, every flag is
 * `false` and the preview is `NONE`. The screen shows no document chrome at all
 * rather than briefly showing a restaurant the A4 controls, or a retail tenant
 * a thermal preview, and correcting itself a moment later. D31.
 *
 * ## Hiding is usability, not security
 *
 * Nothing here decides what may be saved. `PUT /v1/settings` accepts the whole
 * document profile whatever the browser draws, and a field whose control is
 * hidden keeps whatever value it already had.

/**
 * The document surface a tenant prints on.

 * D163 added the third. It is not a midpoint between the other two: a retail
 * workspace prints its BILL on a roll and its QUOTATIONS on a letterhead, so
 * it needs the thermal bill's controls and the A4 document's controls at the
 * same time. Modelling that as "A4 with a thermal option" or "thermal with
 * extras" would make one of the two a second-class citizen on the screen.
