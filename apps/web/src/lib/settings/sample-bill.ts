/**
 * A sample bill for the Settings preview.
 *
 * ## Why it is per kind of trade (D164)
 *
 * The sample is what the operator actually inspects: whether the logo is too
 * wide, whether the note reads right, whether a long name wraps badly. A bill
 * full of somebody else's trade answers none of that, and it looks like a
 * bug — a clothing shop previewing "Grilled Seer" beside a service charge is
 * being shown a restaurant's bill with their name on it.
 *
 * D163 gave retail a thermal bill, so this list stopped being read only by
 * restaurants — which is how the food catalogue came to be shown to a shop.
 *
 * ## What differs beyond the names
 *
 * A retail bill has **no service charge** and **no table**, and those are not
 * cosmetic: a preview showing a service-charge row to a shop is previewing a
 * line their bill will never print, and a table number on a counter sale is
 * meaningless. The retail sample also carries a variant (a size) and a
 * fractional weight, because those ARE the two things a retail bill shows
 * that a restaurant one does not.
 *
 * Every optional total is otherwise filled deliberately. A sample with no
 * discount and no tax renders none of those rows, so the operator previews a
 * bill missing precisely the lines they are most likely to be checking.
 *
 * `issuedAt` is a fixed date rather than `new Date()`: a preview that changes
 * every render cannot be asserted against, and the date is not what anyone is
 * previewing.
