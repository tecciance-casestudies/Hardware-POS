/**
 * D72 — the printed restaurant bill.
 *
 * ## Why this is asserted on the emitted HTML
 *
 * The bill is the one customer-facing document the app produces, and every
 * failure mode here is silent: a missing logo, a fabricated tax line, a
 * "Balance due" on a bill the guest already settled, or a discount quietly
 * absorbed into the total all look fine in review and wrong on paper.
 *
 * Each conditional row is asserted in BOTH directions — absent when zero,
 * present when not — because a template that dropped the row unconditionally
 * satisfies a one-sided test just as well as a correct one.
