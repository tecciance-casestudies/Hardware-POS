/**
 * Roles and permissions for client-side UI gating.
 *
 * **This file defines neither.** Since Slice 7.3 the single authority is
 * `@hardware-pos/shared`, which the API re-exports too, so the two can no longer
 * drift. Everything below is either a re-export or genuinely browser-only.
 *
 * It previously held a hand-maintained copy of the API's list, and that copy had
 * already fallen behind: `PLATFORM_PROFILE_READ` and `PLATFORM_PROFILE_MANAGE`
 * were added to the API in Slice 4 and never reached here. Nothing compared them,
 * so nothing failed — the client simply could not express a permission the server
 * was already granting. Slice 8's module-aware navigation depends on that list
 * being complete, which is why it is fixed now rather than then.
 *
 * Client-side gating is a usability affordance only. Every route is enforced
 * server-side by `PermissionsGuard` and, where applicable, `ModuleAccessGuard`;
 * hiding a control here does not protect anything.
