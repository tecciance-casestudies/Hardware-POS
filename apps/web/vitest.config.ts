/**
 * Vitest for the web workspace.
 *
 * Node is still the default — the dashboard chart logic, the supplier formatters
 * and the product presentation resolver are all pure. `jsdom` was added in Slice
 * 6C-B.5 for the `*.render.test.tsx` specs only.
 *
 * Those specs need a real DOM for a reason the architectural-test standard makes
 * explicit: asserting "the Sync to QuickBooks button is not rendered" from source
 * text cannot distinguish the button being absent from the pattern no longer
 * matching, and a renamed component would make the check inspect nothing at all.
 * Rendering the component and querying it by accessible role can tell those apart.
 *
 * The `@/` alias mirrors tsconfig `paths` so specs import exactly like app code.
