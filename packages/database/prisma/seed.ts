 *
 * `Tenant.slug` is globally `@unique`, and the Product Owner's own hand-made
 * workspaces hold `grocery-demo` on their machine. Creating the seeded tenant
 * there would raise `P2002` and take the whole seed down with it — on the one
 * machine whose database matters most.
 *
 * The alternatives were worse. Renaming their tenant to claim the slug takes
 * their work hostage to a convention, which D190 already refused. Adopting the
 * row and writing into it makes the seed overwrite a workspace someone is
 * actively using. So the seed **stands aside**: it says plainly that the slug is
 * spoken for, and seeds nothing.
 *
 * On every other machine — every teammate's, and CI's — nothing holds the slug
 * and the workspace is created normally. That is the case this decision exists
 * to serve, which is why it is verified against a database seeded from EMPTY
 * rather than against the author's: the author's is the one database where the
 * skip fires, so it is the one database that cannot prove the happy path.
