-- D128 — an exchange links a return to a sale (Phase 7, step 7.1a).
--
-- Additive: one new table. No existing table, column or row is touched. Nothing
-- is backfilled, because there are no exchanges to backfill — the transaction
-- has never existed.
--
-- Why `replacementSaleId` is nullable: the return leg commits first, so there is
-- a real interval in which an exchange exists with no replacement. A NOT NULL
-- column would make the row unwritable until both legs succeeded, which destroys
-- the recoverable state D128 chose — if the sale fails, the customer holds store
-- credit worth what they handed back and the operator retries.
--
-- Deliberately NOT `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS`. D125c: `IF NOT EXISTS` keys on the
-- NAME, so it silently accepts a different object that happens to share one, and
-- converts "this exists, differently" into "fine". A name collision should fail
-- loudly here, which is the cheapest place to find it.
