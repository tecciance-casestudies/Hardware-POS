/**
 * The canonical role and permission vocabulary (Slice 7.3, 7.4).
 *
 * ## Why this moved here
 *
 * Before Slice 7 the same vocabulary existed three times: a TypeScript `enum` in
 * `apps/api/src/modules/auth/permissions.ts`, a `const` object in
 * `apps/web/src/lib/permissions.ts`, and the `UserRole` enum in the Prisma schema.
 * They had already drifted, in both directions and silently:
 *
 *  • The web copy was missing `PLATFORM_PROFILE_READ` and
 *    `PLATFORM_PROFILE_MANAGE`, added to the API in Slice 4. Every client-side
 *    check for them was therefore a compile error waiting to happen, and the
 *    navigation work in Slice 8 would have been built on an incomplete list.
 *  • `UserRole` here listed only `Cashier`, `Manager` and `Admin` — `OWNER` and
 *    `ACCOUNTANT` were absent, despite being real, persisted, seeded roles that
 *    the API grants permissions to.
 *
 * Neither was caught by a test, because no test compared the copies. Both are now
 * defined once, here, and the copies re-export. Parity specs on both sides compare
 * this file against the Prisma enum.
 *
 * ## Why `const` objects rather than `enum`
 *
 * This package must stay importable from the browser, so it cannot depend on
 * `@hardware-pos/database` (which pulls in the Prisma client) and avoids
 * TypeScript `enum` runtime emit. Each declaration exports a value and a
 * same-named union type, which supports every use the `enum` supported:
 * `Permission.SALE_CREATE` as a value, `Permission` as a type, and
 * `Object.values(Permission)` at runtime.
 *
 * ## What this file is NOT
 *
 * It is not an authority on what a *tenant* has enabled — that is `ModuleKey` and
 * the effective business profile. Roles say what a user may do; modules say what
 * the tenant runs. Both must hold, and they are enforced by separate guards.
 */

/**
 * Staff roles.
 *
 * Values are the persisted strings in `User.role` and must match the Prisma
 * `UserRole` enum exactly — `authorization.parity.spec.ts` proves it. Changing a
 * value here without a migration would orphan every existing row, so these are
 * append-only in practice.
