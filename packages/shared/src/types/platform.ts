/**
 * Platform vocabulary — the single authority for the business-type and module
 * unions (convergence plan Phase 0, D56/D57).
 *
 * ## Why these live here and not in two places
 *
 * The web client must never import `@hardware-pos/database` (the Prisma client
 * cannot reach a browser bundle), so it used to hand-maintain string-literal
 * copies of these unions in `apps/web/src/lib/platform-api.ts`, guarded by a
 * regex that parsed the file as text — a guard that broke twice during D55
 * when a comment landed inside the union. This package is browser-safe by
 * design, so the unions live here once; the web imports them, and an API-side
 * contract spec compares these values against the Prisma enums **at runtime**,
 * in both directions, with no regex involved.
 *
 * ## The `as const` array + derived union pattern
 *
 * Each vocabulary is declared as a readonly array with the type derived from
 * it, so the runtime values and the compile-time union cannot drift — there is
 * nothing to keep in sync.

/**
 * What kind of business a tenant runs. Drives the domain registry

 *
 * D57: `TILE_SHOP` and `RETAIL` are gone. The pilot tile shop *is* a
 * hardware-template business (PO decision, 2026-08-14), and `RETAIL` was a
 * speculative value nothing ever used. One value per workspace template.
 *
 * **D120 supersedes D57 on `RETAIL` only.** A clothing retailer is now in scope,
 * so the value returns — appended, matching the order
 * `ALTER TYPE … ADD VALUE` produces in the database. `TILE_SHOP` stays gone;
 * that finding was about an entity, not a template.
 *
 * This list is a hand-maintained mirror of the Prisma enum, not a derivation of
 * it — so a value added to `schema.prisma` must be added here too. The compiler
 * catches the omission the moment a descriptor references the new value, which
 * is how this one was caught.
