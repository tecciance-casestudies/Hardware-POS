/**
 * Role templates — the roles a tenant is created with (Phase 1.5, D36/D37).
 *
 * ## What a template is
 *
 * A name, a stable key, and a set of permissions. Cloned into each tenant at
 * provisioning, after which the tenant owns its copy and may rename it. Nothing
 * reads a template at authorization time: the database rows are the authority,
 * and these are only what those rows are seeded from.
 *
 * ## Why the key exists separately from the name
 *
 * `Role` is keyed `@@unique([tenantId, name])` — on a display name an admin can
 * change. A built-in role identified by its display name stops being findable the
 * moment someone renames "Manager" to "Supervisor", and the code that looks it up
 * either creates a duplicate or silently grants nothing. `key` is the identifier;
 * `name` is presentation.
 *
 * ## Operational roles are data, not enum members
 *
 * `UserRole` stays at the six built-in platform roles (the sixth, SALESPERSON,
 * arrived from `main` on 2026-08-31). The Waiter, the food-service Cashier and
 * the Receptionist are *rows*, because adding them to a persisted enum would
 * commit the whole platform to a vocabulary before the features exist, and
 * enum values cannot be removed without a destructive migration.
 *
 * Being enum-backed does not make a role universal, though. Salesperson is
 * built in — a tenant cannot delete it — yet only the HARDWARE template offers
 * it (D108). "Built in" says who owns the definition; the per-template lists at
 * the bottom of this file say who gets a row. (That is also why trimming the template catalogue on 2026-08-17
 * deleted template OBJECTS below but no enum value: the enum is persisted
 * data with production users on it; a template is only a seeding blueprint.)

 * Templates for the built-in platform roles that workspaces still SEED.
 *
 * Owner and Cashier survived the trim (PO decision, 2026-08-17): the ADMIN,
 * MANAGER and ACCOUNTANT templates were removed outright with the rest of
 * the unstaffed catalogue — a blueprint no template list references is not
 * dormant, it is an invitation to reintroduce the sprawl. The `UserRole`
 * ENUM keeps every value: it is a persisted database enum, existing users
 * sit on those values and resolve through `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` on the legacy
 * fallback, and existing tenants keep their already-seeded rows. Removing a
 * template stops NEW seeding; it rewrites no one's authority.
 *
 * Salesperson is the third (D108, PO decision 2026-09-08): owner-equivalent,
 * and offered by the HARDWARE template alone. It lives in this list because
 * it is enum-backed and undeletable like the other two — NOT because every
 * workspace seeds it. This list is the catalogue of built-ins; which of them
 * a workspace receives is decided by the per-template lists below, which is
 * why GENERAL selects its two explicitly rather than reading this list whole.
 *
 * Each template derives its permissions from `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` rather than
 * restating them, so the two cannot disagree; the parity spec still asserts
 * the equality.
