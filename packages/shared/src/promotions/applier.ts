/**
 * The promotion applier (D123, 4.2) — the one place a promotion becomes money.
 *
 * ## Why this lives in `shared`
 *
 * The till has shown a promotion BADGE since before this phase, and could not
 * price it. If the maths lived only on the server, a customer would read
 * "Buy 2 Get 1", watch the cart total ignore it, and be charged something else
 * at settlement. That is the defect 3.14 fixed for tax, except worse — with tax
 * the customer saw the wrong number after agreeing; with a promotion they read
 * the offer first.
 *
 * So `sales.service` and `lib/cart.computeTotals` both call THIS function. There
 * is nothing for them to drift from.
 *
 * Consequence: `shared` carries no runtime dependencies so a browser can import
 * it, which rules out `Prisma.Decimal`. Plain numbers with cent rounding, the
 * idiom `tax-breakdown.ts` and `returns.calc` already document. The server wraps
 * the result for persistence; both sides run this arithmetic and agree by
 * construction.
 *
 * ## The rule this encodes (D123)
 *
 * A promotion reduces the LINE it applies to, computed once at sale time and
 * frozen. It is never re-derived at return time.
 *
 * Two shirts at 1,000 and a tie at 500, tie free. Allocating that 500 saving
 * order-wide by line value would give the tie a weight of 500 against the
 * shirts' 2,000, so returning the tie would refund 500 − 100 = 400 on an item
 * the customer paid nothing for. Per line, the tie carries the whole 500 and
 * refunds 0.

 * D166/D171 — a SAME-PRODUCT reward the basket is one step short of.
 *
 * ## The gap this fills
 *
 * `outstandingRewards` reports nothing for a same-product BOGO, because on
 * its own terms nothing is owed: a "buy 5 get 1" is six for the price of
 * five, so a customer holding five has earned nothing yet. The arithmetic
 * there is unchanged and still correct.
 *
 * What changed is what the TILL does about it.
 *
 * ## D171 — this now gates payment, and D166 said it never would
 *
 * D166 called this an offer to decline and kept it out of `canPay`,
 * reasoning that refusing a five-tie sale is hostile. The PO reversed that
 * deliberately: a customer who qualified for a free item must not be let
 * out of the shop without it, and every BUY_X_GET_Y is to behave the same
 * way regardless of whether the reward is the same product or another one.
 *
 * The consequence is real and was accepted: with `buy 5 get 1`, a basket of
 * exactly five, eleven, seventeen — each is one short of a group — cannot
 * be paid for until the free unit is added.
 *
 * This function is still SEPARATE from `outstandingRewards` because the two
 * arithmetics are genuinely different (an entitlement shortfall versus a
 * remainder within a group). `incompleteOffers` below is the union, and is
 * what a till should read: one list, one gate, nothing to keep in step.
 *
 * ## When it fires
 *
 * Only once the BUY threshold within the current group is already met, so a
 * basket of one tie is not nagged about an offer four units away. With
 * `buy 5 get 1` (group of six): five ties prompts, six does not (the reward
 * has landed), eleven prompts again for the second.
 *
 * Different-product rewards are not reported here. Those go through
 * `outstandingRewards` the moment they are earned, and prompting before that
 * would be a second, weaker voice on the same offer.
 */
/**
 * D171 — every BUY_X_GET_Y this basket has not finished, as one list.
 *
 * ## Why this exists rather than two lists at the call site
 *
 * The till must now treat both shapes identically: the same notice, the same
 * emoji, the same refusal to take payment. Two lists merged by the caller is
 * two places to forget one of them — and the failure would be silent and
 * one-sided, a cashier able to pay through a same-product offer but not a
 * cross-product one, or the reverse.
 *
 * So the union lives here, next to both halves, and the till reads exactly
 * one thing.
 *
 * ## The two halves are still computed separately, on purpose
 *
 *  - `outstandingRewards` — the customer EARNED reward units they are not
 *    holding. A shortfall against an entitlement.
 *  - `rewardUpsells` — the customer is inside an incomplete group of a
 *    same-product offer. A remainder, not an entitlement.
 *
 * They are different sums and neither reduces to the other. Merging the
 * OUTPUT is safe; merging the arithmetic would not be.
 *
 * ## What this deliberately does not report
 *
 * A basket nowhere near a threshold. One tie against `buy 5 get 1` returns
 * nothing, and two shirts against `buy 5 get 1 tie` returns nothing: the
 * customer has not qualified for anything, so there is nothing to complete
 * and no reason to hold the sale. Blocking there would refuse every small
 * basket in the shop.
