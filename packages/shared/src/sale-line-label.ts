/**
 * How a sold line is named on a document (D120, 2.12).
 *
 * ## Why this lives in `shared` and not beside one renderer
 *
 * A sale line is rendered in **four** places, two per side:
 *
 * | | |
 * |---|---|
 * | `documents.service` | the A4 invoice the server renders |
 * | `receipts.service` | the 80mm thermal receipt the server renders |
 * | `sale-a4-document.tsx` | the A4 the web app renders itself |
 * | `receipt-print.ts` | the client fallback when the server render fails |
 *
 * 1c.7 put the variant on two of them and missed the other two, so the same
 * sale printed with the size from one endpoint and without it from another.
 * Four copies of a formatting rule is four chances to disagree, and the way it
 * was discovered — a customer-facing invoice — is the expensive way.
 *
 * So the rule lives here, in the one package both apps import. A fifth renderer
 * gets it by calling this; the enumerating test in `sale-line-label.spec` fails
 * if one is added that does not.
 *
 * ## The format
 *
 * `Cotton T-Shirt (M — Navy)` — PO, 2026-09-01.
 *
 * Variant names are stored slash-separated (`variantDisplayName` joins option
 * values with `/`, giving `M / Navy`), because that is the compact form the
 * till's picker wants in a narrow row. A document has room to be read aloud,
 * and the PO asked for a hyphen. Converting here rather than changing the
 * stored form keeps the snapshot intact: `variantNameSnapshot` is frozen at
 * sale time (D44) and must not be rewritten to suit a later presentation
 * choice.
 */

/** The separator `variantDisplayName` uses between option values. */
const STORED_SEPARATOR = ' / ';

/** What a document uses instead. An em dash, not a hyphen-minus. */
const DOCUMENT_SEPARATOR = ' — ';

/**
 * `Cotton T-Shirt (M — Navy)`, or just the product name when no variant was
 * sold.
 *
 * `variantName` is the D44 snapshot, not the live variant: renaming a size
 * later must not rewrite an old receipt.
 *
 * A blank or whitespace-only snapshot is treated as absent rather than printed
 * as empty parentheses — a line that read `Cotton T-Shirt ()` would look like a
 * bug to a customer holding the paper.

export function saleLineLabel(
  productName: string,
  variantName: string | null | undefined,

/**
 * The promotion note printed beneath a sale line (D123, 4.6).
 *
 * A bill that shows a tie at 0.00 with no explanation reads as a pricing error;
 * naming the offer is what makes the zero legible, and it is what a customer
 * argues a return from. `promotionNameSnapshot` is frozen at sale time (D44), so
 * a reprint says what the customer was actually given even if the promotion has
 * since been renamed or deleted.
 *
 * Here for the same reason `saleLineLabel` is: four renderers print a sale line,
 * and `sale-line-renderers.spec` enumerates all four and fails if one skips it.
 *
 * Returns `null` when there is nothing to say, so a renderer's own falsy check
 * stays a single `?`.

/**
 * The quantity printed on a sale or return line — D134d (`6.5`).
 *
 * `0.750` with a unit of `kg` becomes `0.75 kg`; `2` with no unit stays `2`.
 *
 * ## Why this is shared, like `saleLineLabel` above
 *
 * Four renderers print a sale line, and before this they formatted quantity
 * three different ways — one of them a ternary whose branches were identical.
 * `2.12` is the record of what that costs: `1c.7` fixed two of the four, so the
 * same sale printed correctly from one endpoint and wrongly from another.
 * `sale-line-renderers.spec` enumerates all four and fails if one skips this.
 *
 * ## Trailing zeroes go
 *
 * The column is `Decimal(12,3)` because loose goods sell by weight, so every
 * quantity arrives as `2.000` or `0.750`. A shop counting shirts should read
 * `2`, not `2.000`. The digits are trimmed from the string; nothing is
 * recomputed and nothing is rounded.
 *
 * ## The unit is a SNAPSHOT
 *
 * `null` when the line carries none — a whole product, or a line written before
 * D134d — and the output is then exactly what it was before this existed, which
 * is what leaves every historical document unchanged.
