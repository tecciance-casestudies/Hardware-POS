/**
 * The retail domain — clothing first, grocery behind it (D120).
 *
 * D57 removed `RETAIL` on the finding that there was no Retail template and the
 * value carried zero rows. D120 supersedes that on its facts: a clothing retailer
 * is now in scope. The reasoning was never wrong — re-adding is cheap precisely
 * because the removal was clean.
 *
 * ## How this differs from HARDWARE, and why it is a separate descriptor
 *
 * The two share a rail, a module list and a capability set. They differ in the
 * one thing a shop owner cares about on day one:
 *
 * | | HARDWARE | RETAIL |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | inventory | `QUICKBOOKS` — a cache of an upstream ledger | **`LOCAL`** — the tenant owns its numbers |
 * | accounting | `QUICKBOOKS` | **`NONE`** |
 * | QUICKBOOKS module | present | **absent** |
 *
 * That is not a variation of one template; it is the opposite posture. A single
 * descriptor serving both would have to branch on business type somewhere, which
 * is exactly what D56 exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately reused
 *
 * `RETAIL_CAPABILITIES`, `RETAIL_NAVIGATION` and `HARDWARE_ROLE_TEMPLATES` are
 * adopted as-is, per D120's "reuse; do not fork". Three things worth knowing:
 *
 *  1. `RETAIL_CAPABILITIES` already declares `catalogue.variants: true`. **That
 *     is why the whole Phase 1 variant engine works here with no further code** —
 *     the picker, scan resolver, per-variant stock, cart key and stock ledger all
 *     read that capability and never a business type (D56).
 *  2. `RETAIL_NAVIGATION` contains a `/quickbooks` entry, and keeping it is
 *     correct: it is gated on `module: 'QUICKBOOKS'`, which this descriptor does
 *     not enable, so the rail entry never renders. Forking the navigation to
 *     delete a line the module gate already hides would create a second copy to
 *     keep in step for no gain (D93).
 *  3. `HARDWARE_ROLE_TEMPLATES` is Owner + Cashier, which is exactly how a
 *     clothing shop is staffed. A shared constant named for the other domain is
 *     a naming wart, not a coupling — renaming it would touch the hardware
 *     descriptor, and D56's contract is *zero edits to existing domains*.

  /**
   * D64 (2.4) — the clothing catalogue fields.
   *
   * ## Why these are attributes and size/colour are not
   *
   * The test: **if changing the value changes what the cashier scans, it is a
   * variation dimension; if it changes only what the label says, it is an
   * attribute.** A Medium has its own price, barcode and stock row — you sell
   * *a Medium*. "Slim fit" changes nothing the engine touches: not what is
   * scanned, not what is priced, not what is depleted. It is printed and
   * reported on, and nothing more.
   *
   * So size and colour live in `ProductVariationDimension` (Phase 1), and these
   * five live in `Product.attributes` — validated, but never computed on.
   *
   * ## Why every field is optional
   *
   * `required: true` blocks product creation for a tenant that does not track
   * the field. A shop that never records fabric composition should not be unable
   * to add a product; a shop that does gets a validated place to put it.
   *
   * ## Why `brand` is absent — and it now IS an entity
   *
   * This list said brand was "a column eventually (Phase 8 — brand as an
   * entity): filtered and reported on, and free text will not survive real
   * data. Declaring it here now would mean migrating tenants' stored strings
   * into an entity later."
   *
   * **`8.9` built it (D133)**, and the prediction paid off exactly: because
   * `brand` was never an attribute, no tenant had a stored string to migrate.
   * It is `Brand` — a per-tenant row — with a nullable `Product.brandId`. It
   * stays out of this list permanently: an attribute is validated and printed,
   * and a brand is joined to and filtered on.
   *
   * ## Why grocery is absent
   *
   * `schemaForTenant` resolves ONE schema per business type, and clothing and
   * grocery are both `RETAIL`. A merged list would show a clothing shop an
   * "Allergens" field. 2.5 is blocked on a decision to split the enum, which is
   * out of scope while clothing is the pilot.
   *
   * ## Adding is safe; removing is not
   *
   * `validateAttributes` refuses unknown keys, so deleting a field later strands
   * whatever tenants have stored under it on their next full write. This list is
   * a commitment, not a sketch.
