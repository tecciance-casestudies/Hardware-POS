/**
 * Domain packs (convergence plan §4, D56).
 *
 * A DomainDescriptor is everything that varies by workspace template, declared
 * in one file per vertical. Before this existed, adding a vertical touched
 * fifteen places — seven scattered maps plus inline predicates — and eleven of
 * them failed SILENTLY: `NAV_BY_BUSINESS_TYPE[t] ?? RETAIL_NAV` handed an
 * unknown domain the retail rail, `resolveBusinessKind` fell back to retail
 * chrome, and six page bodies did their own `=== 'RESTAURANT' || …`
 * comparisons. HOTEL shipped missing seven of the fifteen, which is how a
 * hotel workspace got the restaurant sidebar and the retail POS behind it.
 *
 * The extension contract this type exists to keep:
 *
 * > A vertical that composes existing behaviours = one descriptor file, one
 * > registry line, one BusinessType value. Zero edits to existing domains.
 *
 * Fields for later phases (fulfilment provider spec, catalogue attribute
 * schema, seed data) are added HERE when their phase lands — additively, so
 * existing descriptors keep compiling until they choose to answer.

     * The comment on `catalogue` is right, and this is the exception that

     * because a silent fallback hands a vertical **another vertical's**
     * answer — which is exactly the defect D165 fixes.

     * Omitting this field falls back to a NEUTRAL list (`Standard Item 1`
     * and so on), not to hardware's. Silence therefore produces honest
     * filler that claims no trade, and the failure mode the required rule
     * guards against cannot occur. Making it required would instead force
     * an edit to the food-service and general descriptors — templates
     * another team owns — to declare something about a screen food
     * service never even renders.
     *
     * Illustration only. Nothing here is sold, priced, stocked or
     * provisioned; a workspace's real catalogue comes from its seed pack.
