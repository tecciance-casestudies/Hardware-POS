/**
 * The hardware/retail domain — the original product (D56/D57).
 *
 * D57: this is the vertical's ONE descriptor. The pilot tile shop is a
 * hardware-template business (PO decision, 2026-08-14); `TILE_SHOP` and
 * `RETAIL` were removed from `BusinessType` rather than deprecated, because
 * they were ten days old and carried zero data.
 *
 * This is also the only descriptor that names QuickBooks (§4.9 of the
 * convergence plan): every other domain declares `accountingProvider: 'NONE'`
 * and omits the QUICKBOOKS module, and a tripwire enforces that a copy-pasted
 * descriptor cannot silently carry the integration into a new vertical.
