 * ("variation is resolved by a resolver, and the result is a value object")
 * generalised from the product screens to the whole platform, because the
 * inline predicates it replaced omitted HOTEL in seven separate places.
 *
 * ## Capabilities are affordances, never permission
 *
 * A hidden control is usability; the server still refuses the request. A
 * tenant whose `fulfilment.kind` is IMMEDIATE is refused by `ModuleAccessGuard`
 * on every table-service route regardless of what any client renders.
 *
 * ## A capability describes what works TODAY
 *
 * `collections` and `components` were declared false everywhere until the
 * phases that built them flipped them on (components: Phase 8/D65 for food
 * service). A capability that is true with nothing behind it would teach
 * consumers to distrust the object.
