/**
 * Splitting a recorded tax total across the rates that produced it (D122, 3.12).
 *
 * ## Why this is allocation and not calculation
 *
 * `SaleItem.taxAmount` is always 0 — splitting the order-level tax across lines
 * is per-line COMPUTATION, parked with grocery. So a breakdown cannot be summed
 * from the lines; it has to divide the tax the sale actually recorded.
 *
 * That division is the same weighting `returns.calc` uses to allocate a refund:
 *
 *     share = recordedTax × Σ(taxable × rate for this rate) / Σ(taxable × rate)
 *
 * Both consume the primitives here rather than each expressing it, because two
 * ways to divide one total is two chances to disagree — the failure 2.12 found
 * across four document renderers, discovered on a customer-facing invoice.
 *
 * ## Why it lives in `shared`
 *
 * A sale line is rendered in four places, two per app. `saleLineLabel` is here
 * for the same reason, and `sale-line-renderers.spec` enumerates the four and
 * fails if one skips either function.

 *
 * ## Why this is shared
 *
 * 3.10 narrowed the base on the SERVER and left the till's own preview alone, so
 * a cashier was quoted 18% on an exempt item the server then charged nothing
 * for. That is the retail twin of audit item A2 — "its cashier quotes a total
 * the server disagrees with" — and it is the same one-rule-two-implementations
 * failure 2.12 and 3.12 already cost this branch.
 *
 * So the rule lives here, in the one package both apps import, and
 * `sales.service` and `lib/cart.computeTotals` both call it. They cannot drift,
 * because there is nothing to drift from.
 *
 * ## The rule
 *
 *     base = discountedSubtotal − orderDiscount − Σ(exempt line net after its
 *                                                   share of that discount)
 *
 * An exempt line takes its share of the order discount out WITH it, using the
 * same proportional formula `returns.calc` uses to allocate that discount, so
 * the sale, the refund and the till all divide it the same way. Leaving the
 * share behind would shrink the taxable lines' base twice.
 *
 * Floored at zero: rounding is the only way `exemptNet` can exceed the base, but
 * a negative base would produce negative tax.
 *
 * Plain numbers with cent rounding rather than `Prisma.Decimal` — `shared` must
 * stay free of runtime dependencies so the browser can import it, and this is
 * the idiom `returns.calc` already documents ("the same primitives the sale
 * used"). The server wraps the result for its final multiply, so both sides run
 * THIS arithmetic and agree by construction.
